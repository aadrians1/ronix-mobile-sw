                SECTION -0- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
                ===============================

CodeGuard must be installed into a working hard disk installation of 
Borland C++ 4.51 or 4.52 to function properly.  Do not delete Borland C++
4.5x before installing CodeGuard.  Running Borland C++ from the CD-ROM
drive is not supported if you are using CodeGuard.

If you are running Borland C++ 4.50, see Section 4 "Updating Borland C++
4.50."  

CodeGuard requires 9 megabytes of available hard disk in addition to that
required by Borland C++.  See also the system requirements section of the
INSTALL.TXT file which shipped with Borland C++.


                SECTION -1- INSTALLATION NOTES
                ==============================

A) Installing under Windows NT or Windows 95

        The install will fail if you enter any paths which make use
        of long file names (more than 8 letters in the name,
        more than 3 letters in the extension, or a total path name
        which exceeds 128 characters).

B) Installing Under Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups

        Our installation program performs a complicated series of actions
        including large amounts of file copying, decompression of files, and
        joining together pieces of split files. As a result of this, it is
        extremely sensitive to device drivers or resident programs which may
        interfere with operation.

        In order to guarantee that installation proceeds smoothly under
        16-bit Windows, we recommend that you perform a "clean boot" prior
        to installing. In order to perform a clean boot, do the following:

        1. Backup your win.ini, system.ini, autoexec.bat, and config.sys.
        2. Edit your config.sys so that it consists of only the following
           lines: (insert any "required drivers" that are needed for
           reading a CD-ROM or for network connections, at the end of
           the file. Examples of drivers which are _not_ required are
           EMM386.EXE, QDMI.SYS, and SMARTDRV.EXE. If you are unsure
           whether a device driver is required, assume it is not.)

                device=c:\windows\himem.sys
                files=40
                buffers=30
                stacks=9,256
                <insert required drivers here>.

        3. Edit your autoexec.bat so that it consists only of the
           following lines:

                path=c:\;c:\dos;c:\windows
                prompt $p$g
                SET TEMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP
                <insert required drivers here>

        4. Edit your system.ini so that the line which starts with 
           "shell=" says "shell=progman.exe". This will ensure that
           you load program manager and not a program manager 
           replacement (such as Dashboard).

        5. Edit your win.ini so that all lines which start with "load="
           or "run=" have a space after the equals sign.

        6. Be sure to restore the original files after installation.

        
        If you are running a high resolution video driver on a high 
        resolution video card, it is recommended that you switch 
        display drivers so that you are using the standard VGA or 
        SVGA display drivers. 


                SECTION -2- TROUBLESHOOTING INSTALL PROBLEMS
                ============================================

A) Internal Error, Unable to Start Install
        
        1) Error -2: the install utility was unable to create a 
           temporary directory needed for the installation. Please
           check your autoexec.bat to see if there is a TMP or
           TEMP environment variable. If there is one, verify that
           it points to a valid directory on a drive with at least
           ten megabytes of free space (fifteen if you are using
           disk compression). If you do not have a variable set,
           the install program will place its files in the directory
           \WINDOWS\BORLAND.TMP. If there is not enough space on
           the drive which contains Windows, be sure to set this
           variable.

        2) Error -3: there was an error while copying and decompressing
           INSTRUN.EXE, which is used to launch phase two of the
           installation. Check to be sure there is sufficient space
           in your temp directory, boot clean (if you are running
           Windows 3.1), and attempt to install from the hard drive.
           (see section 2F) If the error persists, see section 2E for
           an explanation of corrupted .pak files.

        3) Error -69: INSTRUN.EXE failed to execute. This is probably
           due to either file corruption or memory corruption. If
           you are running Windows 3.1, perform a clean boot (see
           section 1B); otherwise, perform a hard drive install
           (see section 2F), or check section 2E.

B) Data Integrity or Bad Sector on Disk Errors

        If you receive one of these errors, you may need to get a
        replacement disk set. If running a disk checking utility
        reports a bad sector or data integrity problems, contact
        Borland's Disk Replacement Line at 1-800-621-3132.

C) Install Program Terminates Prematurely

        If the install program stops for no apparent reason without
        error messages, it is possible that certain support files
        are write protected. To check this, switch to your WINDOWS
        directory, type "attrib *.*", and check the resulting
        output for the "r" attribute. If any file has this flag
        set, you need to clear it by typing "attrib -r <filename>".
        Repeat this process for the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

        (If attempting this procedure under NT or Windows 95,
        remember that the WINDOWS directory is called WINNT and WIN95
        by default under those two operating systems).

D) "Unable to write to destination file" error.

        If the install program stops and returns an "unable to write
        to destination file: filename.pak" error, it means that
        the install program is not able to create certain files
        which are contained in the .pak file. This problem typically
        happens because the files are already in use, but can
        also be a result of incorrect file permissions.

        To correct this problem, you need to do two things:
        1. If running 16-bit Windows, perform a "clean boot".
        2. Follow the directions in section 2C for making sure that
           files are not write protected.

        If neither of these solves the problem, you can change the
        names of the files which the install program is attempting
        to overwrite, restart windows, and try again.

E) "Error: 386 or Greater required"

        Prior to unpacking most of the .pak files, the installation
        program copies them onto the hard drive and then decompresses
        them. Under certain circumstances, these files can become
        corrupted while being copied onto the hard drive. "386 or
        Greater required" is one of several error messages which
        are displayed when this type of problem occurs.

        In the event that you receive an error message like this one,
        or which indicates that you have corrupted .pak files,
        you need to _slow down_ the speed of your microprocessor.
        This will reduce the difference in rates of activity between
        the floppy drive, the processor, and the hard drive, and will
        reduce the likelihood of corruption.

F) Hard Drive installation

        If you have 40 megabytes of additional hard drive space,
        you may be interested in installing the product from the
        hard drive. The primary advantage of this would be to
        increase the speed of the installation. In order to install
        from the hard drive, copy the install disks or the install
        directory of the CD into a temporary directory on the hard
        drive, and run INSTALL.EXE from that directory.

options.


                SECTION -4- UPDATING BORLAND C++ 4.50
                =====================================

CodeGuard must be installed into a working hard disk installation of 
Borland C++ 4.51 or 4.52 to function properly.  If you own version 4.50
of Borland C++, you are eligible for a free update which can be obtained
by calling the Borland order desk at 1-800-645-4559.  Outside of North
America, contact your local Borland office for pricing and availability
of the update.

A) Patching Borland C++ 4.50

        The CodeGuard installation program will not install unless version
        4.51 or 4.52 of Borland C++ is detected.  For your convenience, a
        patch has been provided on the CodeGuard CD-ROM which will update
        your copy of Borland C++ 4.50 to version 4.51 to allow CodeGuard to
        be installed.  To apply the patch:

        1. Change into the \PATCH directory on the CodeGuard CD-ROM
        2. Run the batch file PATCH.BAT
        3. Follow the instructions on the usage screen to specify the exact
           parameters required for proper application of the patch

        When running PATCH.BAT, it is critical that accurate information be
        passed as parameters or you will run the risk of getting an
        incomplete application of the patch.  For this reason, Borland
        strongly recommends that 4.50 users obtain your free update of
        Borland C++ by calling the Borland Order Desk at 1-800-645-4559 and
        reinstall at your earliest possible convenience.  Outside of North
        America, contact your local Borland representative for pricing and
        availability of the update.  The patched version of Borland C++ 4.51
        should be considered A TEMPORARY MEASURE ONLY to allow you to use
        CodeGuard while waiting for your update to arrive.

B) Precautions for modified files

        If you have made any changes to files in your Borland C++ 4.50
        installation, the patch program will not be able to update those
        files. A typical instance of this is the case where you have
        modified OWL, BIDS, or OCF source code.  Applying the patch to
        modified source will result in a mix of patched and unpatched files,
        which will likely render the source unbuildable.  If you have
        modified these source files, make a backup of your work before
        applying the patch.  After running the patch followed by the
        CodeGuard installation program you will once again have a usable
        version of the source into which you can reintroduce your
        modifications if desired.

C) Strange Behavior using Borland C++

        If you experience any anomalous behavior after applying this patch,
        the likely cause is that the patch did not get completely applied
        and your installation has a mix of 4.50 and 4.51 components.  In
        this case, the simplest and safest course of action would be to:

        1. Delete \BC45 entirely
        2. Reinstall Borland C++ 4.50 for the time being
        3. Order an update for Borland C++ from Borland
        4. Reinstall from your new updated CD-ROM before installing
           CodeGuard

        A more difficult but quicker course of action would be to try and
        diagnose the cause of the incomplete patch application.  PATCH.BAT
        redirects information to the file PATCH.LOG at runtime which can aid
        you in figuring out if and why the patch may have failed.  See also
        section 4F below for information on warnings and errors.

D) Long patch time

        Depending on your CPU, hard disk speed, and how many features of
        Borland C++ 4.5 you have installed, this patch will take between
        20 minutes and 2 hours to apply.

        PATCH.BAT should not be run under Windows NT.

E) Pipeline product registration software

        PATCH.BAT will add a directory \BC45\PIPELINE to your installation
        of Borland C++. This directory contains electronic product
        registration software.  If you would like to register your copy of
        Borland C++ electronically using a modem from within North America,
        run \BC45\PIPELINE\REGISTER.EXE.  Note that this program is entirely
        different from \BC45\BIN\REGISTER.EXE which is an OLE 2 registration
        utility. By registering your copy of Borland C++, you will be
        notified of new versions and be eligible for special upgrade prices.

F) Errors and warnings

        The Borland C++ 4.50 installation program will have installed
        different sets of files depending on the options you chose when
        installing.  Also, you may have chosen to copy diagnostic libraries
        to your hard drive, or have installed patches obtained from
        Borland's FTP site or CompuServe. PATCH.BAT has been designed to
        update all valid combinations of Borland C++ 4.50 files.  However,
        because of this flexibility you are very likely to see several
        harmless warnings while applying the patch.

        If the patch program is unable to locate the correct files to patch,
        you will see the message:

                Warning wpt0015: Old File does not exist

        This may indicate one of the following cases:

        1. You have previously deleted or have not installed a file
           which PATCH.BAT has attempted to patch.  In this case the file
           will be skipped, which is usually the right action.  If you
           wish to replace a missing file, you must reinstall from your
           Borland C++ CD-ROM and then reapply the patch.

        2. You have specified incorrect parameters to PATCH.BAT.  If you
           seem to get many errors quickly, this is likely the case.
           Use control-break to stop the batch file and restart it using
           the correct parameters.

        The patch program will report the following message if it determines
        that a file does not need to be patched:

                New Version of File 'FILENAME' already exists.

        This may indicate one of the following cases:

        1. You already have Borland C++ 4.51 installed.

        2. You have already applied the patch.

        In either case, the patch program has verified that your software
        is up to date and you need not take further action.

        The patch program will report the following message if it determines
        that a file was skipped because its contents did not match the
        version which shipped in Borland C++ 4.50.

    Warning wpt0036: Old File not found. However, a file of the same name
               was found. No update done since file contents do not match.

        This may indicate one of the following cases:

        1. You have already applied patches to Borland C++ 4.50.
           In this case the warning can safely be ignored.

        2. You have modified source to OWL, BIDS, OCF, or Examples.
           In this case, see section 4B above.

        3. You are applying PATCH.BAT to a version of Borland C++
           previous to version 4.50.  In this case, you will not be able
           to install CodeGuard until you upgrade.  Do not attempt
           to apply the PATCH.BAT to versions of Borland C++ other than
           4.50.

        4. You have installed another product which has updated a file which
           was to be updated.  This is likely in the case of BWCC.DLL and
           other DLLs which reside in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.  This
           case will require you to compare time and date stamps of the
           versions you have installed against the versions on your BC++
           CD-ROM to determine the correct course of action.

       There are a variety of more serious errors which the patch program
       is capable of emitting, and none of which are expected to occur.
       See the file PTERROR.TXT for a complete listing of error messages
       and their likely causes.
