<p><b><font color="#FF0000">The amount of warning text we have added for
newbies since these kits were introduced in Nov-98, makes this page almost
seem like a war zone.</font></b>
<p><b>To simplify it:</b>
<br>If you are a newbie, and know nothing about electronics, and possibly
only interested in play station mod chips, then don't buy the kit. Help
isn't easy to find when it doesn't work. If you are a keen enthusiast interested
in Microcontrollers and PICmicro development, then it's hard to find a
more cost effective programmer than these. About an hour or two, to put
it together for most people. 1000's have now been sold.
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=-1>We
still get questions like, which way do I put in the resistors, which way
do I put in the LEDs, why aren't the wire links supplied in with the kit,
what is a wall wart or plug pack? If you don't know the answers to these
questions, then please do us both a favor and don't buy any of these kits.</font></font></font></b>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>Most Frequently Asked Questions:</b>
<p><b><font color="#3333FF">(Q1) How long before I get it?</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#3333FF">(A1) If it's in stock, then it still depends
on where you live. All units are shipped from Hong Kong. If you are in
Hong Kong, 1-2 days, Australia 4-8 days, USA/Canada 8-10 days (had been
4 weeks once), South Africa could be 3-5 weeks, and some South American
countries including Chile could be 6 weeks, but normally I quote everyone
8 to 14 days. </font><font color="#FF0000">But Please, wait 3 weeks before
asking about kits sent from HK.</font><font color="#3333FF"> This is in
the hands of the postal system. It is sent standard Air Mail, so there
is no method of tracking the package.</font></b>
<p>(Q2) How much will it cost me?
<br>(A2) The prices quoted are in USD, this is converted at the current
exchange rate to AUD and rounded up.
<p>(Q3) I have a 7407, or I was supplied a 7407 in the kit. How do I configure
it to work?
<br>(A3) <a href="#7407">7407 Configuration Table:</a>
<p>(Q4) I live in Australia. Can I pop in and pick one up?
<br>(A4) We have never seen a kit. These are shipped from Hong Kong. The
problems of dealing with Australian Customs for simple imports has been
resolved by not dealing with them. This becomes your problem, however we
haven't heard of anyone being pulled up with customs on these items. Yes
you can mail order from Australia, but verify it with an email message
also.
<p>(Q5) Will it program a PIC12C508/04/P, which is the Play Station MOD
Chip?
<br>(A5) Yes. You must get your own code. Heaps of this on the Internet.
See my <a href="508.html">508.html</a> page for instance for Sydney mod
chips, RIE, and OZ Chips.
<p>(Q6) Is there a Schematic?
<br>(A6) It is shown at:&nbsp; <b><font face="CG Times (W1)"><font color="#3333FF"><a href="http://www.picallw.com/">http://www.picallw.com/</a></font></font></b>
<p>(Q7) Will these programmers read a PICmicro Chip?
<br>(A7) Yes, providing it's not code protected. Most commercial applications
you can bet, will have the code protection bit(s) set.
<p>(Q8) Can I C.O.D. these products?
<br>(A8) No, they are shipped from Hong Kong. We can't do C.O.D. from Hong
Kong.
<p>(Q9)<b> I only want to program PIC16F84's.</b> Do I have to register
the software?
<br>(A9) No, if you have a look at <a href="download.html">Don's Download
Dungeon,</a> you will find drivers for DOS, W9x, and NT for free.
<br>Nigel Goodwin wrote these for DonTronics, and they are free to use
for everyone. Both the registered and the free software will work with
the DIY KIT-96, and the DonTronics <a href="dt001.html">DT001</a> board.
Bojan has now available a free 84 burner aboard his <a href="p16pro.html">P16PRO</a>
software.
<p>(Q10) I can't get the new Stealth code to load correctly with P16PRO.
<br>(A10) I don't answer any questions on playstation code, but if I did,
I would tell you that when downloading any HEX file directly from net,
you should edit the HEX file with an asci editor and erase last character
in the line if it is different from
<br>0,..9,A..F Webmasters should never put a raw hex file on the web, but
a zip file.
<p>(Q11) What are the power supply specs?
<br>(A11) As written on the overlay of the kit 96 board: 16 to 30 VDC,
12 to 20VAC. Anything greater than 100ma is fine.
<br>The DC input has a diode bridge, so polarity isn't a problem.
<p>(Q12) I have built the unit and the LEDs don't seem to be doing much.
<br>(A12) Grab the Windows P16PRO software which is linked from the <a href="p16pro.html">P16PRO</a>
page. This will burn 84 type chips without registration, and has a large
help file, including the setup parameters and test features. You have to
configure your port and hardware, then you can test the LED operation.
<p>(Q13) I can't figure out the holes for sockets on the KIT 96 board.
What are the white lines?
<br>(A13) The Aries type ZIF socket fits the 40 pin holes and does all
chips. The P16PRO software tells you where to place the chip in the socket.
The 8 and 18 pin positions are for smaller sockets if you wish to use them.
The white lines are links.

THEPAGE@ (Eric and Denise)</tt>
<p><tt>Just a quick note to say a big Thank You.</tt>
<p><tt>I ordered a KIT96 PIC Programmer from you about 10 days ago, andreceived
the product two days ago.</tt>
<p><tt>It took only about 45 minutes to 1 hr to put together and really
the</tt> <tt>instructions were written well. Aside from having to test
for polarity</tt> <tt>of the L.E.D.s ( this was not documented, and I just
was not sure from</tt> <tt>looking at the schematic) it went together without
a single hitch.</tt>
<p><tt>I programmed my first PIC after assembly and it worked like a charm.</tt>
<p><tt>I am very impressed with the quality of the PCB and the packaging
was</tt> <tt>superb.</tt>
<p><tt>Thanks for answering my previous question about the ID of the powerconnector,
I actually received my order from Hong Kong and my Jamecoorder within about
1 hr of each other (Great timing eh!) and I hadeverything I needed to program
pics at the same time.</tt>
<p><tt>I was very impressed with the speed and quality of the parts and
service</tt> <tt>I received, and would recommend you to anyone.</tt>
<p><tt>Good Job, I appreciate how difficult it must all be with PICs being
as</tt> <tt>popular as they are today.</tt>

Thanks for the speedy shipping to the USA.

VERY VERY easy to do. The kit itself is great, packaged neatly, and an
excellent PCB.&nbsp; It performed flawlessly the first time. Many thanks

<p>Hi Don,
<br>Just dropping you a note that i received my Kit96 PIC programmer today,
10 days after purchasing it through your website (btw, this is 10 days
from time of order to Canada). Now, don't stop reading, but... I am a complete
newbie to electronics and hardware assembly - but you know what?&nbsp;
I assembled the entire kit with *ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS* in about 2 hours...
Not bad for my first kit, I'd say.&nbsp; Anyway, just wanted to say that
probably even a monkey could figure out this kit... it is soooo easy.&nbsp;
But, I just wanted to letcha know that i'm a very happy customer =)

<p>hey don!
<br>i recently got the us$25 kit in the mail that i ordered, i was so excited,
i opened it up and i must say i am totally clueless, you must get this
alot. i thought there would be instructions or something. i have no clue
on how to assemble it, is there anything you can do please?...i really
have alot of backordered playstations, also, i thought the programmer came
with some chips
<br>and software, i really appreciate you helping me out
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">This is a recent message I got. (Name Suppressed)
Sorry, I can't&nbsp; help. I repeat the warnings over and over and over.
If you are clueless, please do us both a favor and don't buy this kit.
Read the conditions of sale. For $25 you get a kit, you don't get a tutorial,
no chips, no ZIF socket, no cable, no wall-wart or plug pack, or anything
else for that matter, just a kit.</font></b>

P16PRO Software Registration:</font></b>
<br>You can <b><a href="p16pro.html">Register P16PRO PICmicro software</a></b>
at DonTronics "on-line", using our web based secure Credit Card system
for $20USD. <b>The P16PRO software will work under DOS, W3.1 or W9x.</b>
<br>This software will allow you to use most "David Tait" variant programmers
to program a very large number of PICmicro devices via the Parallel Printer
Port of a PC. Follow the registration link to read the full story.
<p>This is a kit of parts to use the <font face="CG Times (W1)">P16PRO
software of <b>Bojan Dobaj</b> to program all 8, 18, 28 &amp; 40 pin DIP
serial PICís - see the&nbsp; listing below.</font>
<p><b><font face="CG Times (W1)">Parallel programmed PICís - 16C5X - are
not supported by this programmer.</font></b>
<p>Do not confuse these programming methods with the serial port and parallel
ports of a PC. A serial programmed <font face="CG Times (W1)">PICís refers
to the programming algorithm by which data enters the PIC. In this method
the data bytes are entered serially onto 1 pin (like a shift register)
and the 13V programming voltage is toggled onto a programming pin to latch
and burn the byte. In the parallel programming method the whole byte is
presented on an 8 pin port then the programming voltage is toggled.</font>
<p>You must download the latest version of the <font face="CG Times (W1)">P16PRO
software from:</font>
<br><b><font face="CG Times (W1)"><font color="#3333FF"><a href="http://www.picallw.com/">http://www.picallw.com/</a></font></font></b><b><font face="CG Times (W1)"><font color="#3333FF"><a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/1004/programs.htm"></a></font></font></b>
<p>These are the <font face="CG Times (W1)">PICís that this kit will program:</font>
<br>PIC12C5xx<font face="CG Times (W1)">, PIC14000, PIC16C554, PIC16C556,
PIC16C558, PIC16C61, PIC16C62, PIC16C62A, PIC16CR62,</font>&nbsp; <font face="CG Times (W1)">PIC16C63,

<p>New <font face="CG Times (W1)">PICís can be added by entering them in
the device.ini file of the software.</font>
<p>Schematic. You may download the schematic for the <font face="CG Times (W1)">40
pin hardware version from the website. There are several changes:</font>
<ul>
<li>
R9/680E<font face="CG Times (W1)"> should be labelled R11/680R</font></li>

<li>
for C3 we have used <font face="CG Times (W1)">470uF/35V</font></li>
</ul>
We have made space on the board for <font face="CG Times (W1)">C5/330pF
from pin 6 of the 74LS05 to ground since there has been one only report
that it may be required. We have not supplied this component.</font>
<p>Construction. There are 8 links to add to the board. We have supplied
8 18 28 &amp; 40 pin IC sockets. However, for maximum flexibility in programming
you may wish to supply your own 40 pin wide-slot ZIF socket. Use the 14
pin IC socket to mount the <font face="CG Times (W1)">74LS05. You will
need to connect the programmer to the parallel port of a PC using </font>a
straight through cable from the on-board 25 pin PCB-mounted <font face="CG Times (W1)">subd
connector.</font>

<br>The PIC, you wanted to read with P16PRO is probably code protected.
