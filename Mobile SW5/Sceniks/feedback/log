    I develop products, and use very few during development.  I have mostly used the    PIC microcontrollers, but would be willing to try the scenix product.  Could you send    me some samples and a programmer, or give me specs and I will make a programmer myself using pics.    From my address you can see I am located in Canada.  If this is a problem I will    give you my US mailing address. Submit

    I tried to get informed by your documentation available thru the WEB.    Even though I printed them on all available laser printers, I'm still    unable to read the papers. I use 300dpi printers from HP and     Panasonic together with Acrobat 3.01. Many parts of the letters are     missing on the printout. Some of the info can be guessed out but it's    not easy at all.         For example, the right part of the product brief is much too dark and    I can read it partially now because I modified the printer settings.        I would review all the documents for their readability and     printability on standard b/w 300 dot laser printers.        The title of the product brief looks great, though.            Regards        Martin SchmidSubmit

    Good to see a Microchip challenger!        16C5x types don't have the peripherals required for our products, (yes I know about virtual peripherals, but need physical counters, UARTS, PWM, etc.)        A 50MIP flash device with the peripherals of the PIC16C73 would revolutionise our business (currently using Seimens 16-bit parts to get that kind of power).  Let me know as soon as you are in that market, it could increase our MCU usage ten fold!Submit

    Good to see a Microchip challenger!        16C5x types don't have the peripherals required for our products, (yes I know about virtual peripherals, but need physical counters, UARTS, PWM, etc.)        CAN is becoming an industrial control standard.        A 50MIP flash device with the peripherals of the PIC16C73 plus CAN would revolutionise our business (currently using Seimens 16-bit parts to achieve this).
