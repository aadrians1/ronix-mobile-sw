John,

The IIR filter code is still not working due to functions falling into different pages.

I have calculated the number of cycles to be <2000 with the parameters given in the code.
This will require ~40MIPS for each filter.

Since the input signal is a square wave and has only two states, we can probably replace 3 multiplies
by constants. If this is so, we will be able to do both the 1200Hz and 2200Hz filtering at 20KHz
sampling rate with ~40MIPS. This will leave 10MIPS for other processes, which should be plenty
enough.

Good Luck,
Roland
