<A NAME="Collection File Format"></A><H2>Collection File Format</H2>
A collection file stores all the information that is needed by the
indexing and querying executables.  It is used by the browser tools as
well as by the command-line scripts <B>aindex.pl</B> and <B>aquery.pl</B>,
which allow for easy indexing and searching.
<P>
When you create a collection file, it is given the name
<B>databasename.conf</B>.  (When you pass in a database name as an
argument to either the index or query scripts, leave off the <B>.conf</B>
suffix.)  The <B>.conf</B> file contains a list of attribute-value pairs.
Each attribute must have a value, with the exception of the
<CODE>ExclusionRules</CODE> attribute, which can be left blank, but which must
appear as the last attribute line in the file.
<P>
The scripts that read these files do so in a case-sensitive manner, so
be sure your <B>.conf</B> matches the case usage of the default file
<B>Architext.conf</B> if you are creating it by hand.  
<P>
Below is a sample <B>.conf</B> file:
<P>
<PRE>
  &lt;Collection foobar&gt;
  IndexExecutable /usrhttp://www.scenix.com/bin/Architext/architextIndex
  SearchExecutable /usrhttp://www.scenix.com/bin/Architext/architextSearch
  StemTable /usrhttp://www.scenix.com/bin/Architext/stem.tbl
  StopTable /usrhttp://www.scenix.com/bin/Architext/stop.tbl
  CollectionContents /usr/local/www/html
  CollectionIndex /usrhttp://www.scenix.com/bin/Architext/foobar
  CollectionInfo /usrhttp://www.scenix.com/bin/Architext/foobar.cf
  ExclusionRules /home/u/johndoe/exclude
  &lt;/Collection&gt;
</PRE>
Note that the <CODE>Collection</CODE> and <CODE>/Collection</CODE> tags at the start and
end of the file are also required.
<P>
From the browser, only a few of the attributes of a document
collection are visible.  If you access the collection configuration
files directly, you can see the full range of configurable attributes
for a particular document collection.  Below are definitions of all of
the attributes stored in collection configuration files.
<P>
<A NAME="Attributes Accessible from Forms Interface"></A><H2>Attributes Accessible from Forms Interface</H2>
The following attributes are ones that you can change using 
the admin scripts.  Only short definitions are provided, since
they are explained more fully in the documentation for using the
forms-based <A HREF="AT-helpdoc.html">admin tools in AT-helpdoc.html</A>.
<P>
Below is the list of attributes accessible from the forms interface.
They are defined in the <A HREF="AT-helpdoc.html">admin tools in AT-helpdoc.html</A> documentation.
<P>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="AT-helpdoc.html">IndexFilter</A>
<li><A HREF="AT-helpdoc.html">CollectionContents</A>
<li><A HREF="AT-helpdoc.html">CollectionIndex</A>
<li><A HREF="AT-helpdoc.html">ExclusionRules</A>
<li><A HREF="AT-helpdoc.html">AdminMail</A>
</ul>
<P>
<A NAME="Attributes Hidden from Forms Interface"></A><H2>Attributes Hidden from Forms Interface</H2>
The attributes below are not accessible using the forms tools, but
they are stored along with the attributes visible to the forms tools
in the configuration files.  Change these attributes of a document
collection at your own risk!
<P>
<A NAME="IndexExecutable"></A><H2>IndexExecutable</H2>
It is likely you won't have to change this option for any of your
document collections, assuming your installation of Excite for Web
Servers went smoothly.  If you end up changing the location of the
Architext install home, then you would need to edit this option.  The
index executable is <B>architextIndex</B>, which creates the indexes of a
document collection, necessary for performing searches on a
collection.  The collection needs to know where it resides because it
is invoked by the <B>db-index.cgi</B> script when you have configured a
document collection and are ready to index it.
<P>
<A NAME="SearchExecutable"></A><H2>SearchExecutable</H2>
The <B>Search Executable</B> option is one you are not likely to change
unless you move the location of your Architext install home.  Each
document collection needs to know where the search exectuable,
<B>architextSearch</B>, is in order to invoke it when you perform
queries on your collection.
<P>
<A NAME="StemTable"></A><H2>StemTable</H2>
The <B>Stem Table</B> contains lexical data that is used by Excite, Inc.'s
indexing and search engines.  This attribute won't likely change very
often, unless you move the Architext install home.
<P>
<A NAME="StopTable"></A><H2>StopTable</H2>
The <B>Stop Table</B> also contains lexical data used by the index and
search engines.  This is another attribute that you probably won't
change unless you move the Architext install home.
<P>
<A NAME="CollectionInfo"></A><H2>CollectionInfo</H2>
The <B>CollectionInfo</B> attribute is the name of the info file that is
generated and used by the indexer.  It contains a subset of the
information found in a document-collection <B>.conf</B> file which is
essential to the <B>architextSearch</B> and <B>architextIndex</B> executables.
<P>
<A NAME="Indexing from the Command Line"></A><H2>Indexing from the Command Line</H2>
It is possible to index from the command line using either
<B>aindex.pl</B> or <B>architextIndex</B>.  The first is a perl script that
invokes the <B>architextIndex</B>, which is the binary that actually does
the indexing.  the perl script takes care of parsing the information
in the <B>.conf</B> file and passing in the appropriate command-line
options to the binary.
<P>
<A NAME="aindex.pl"></A><H3>aindex.pl</H3>
Indexing can be invoked using this script by simply typing <CODE>aindex.pl
databasename</CODE>.  The information about the database you wish to index
should be stored in a file called <B>databasename.conf</B>.  The format of
the <B>.conf</B> file is described above in the <A HREF="#Collection File Format">Collection File Format</A>
section.
<P>
<A NAME="architextIndex"></A><H3>architextIndex</H3>
This is the binary that does the actual indexing.  The syntax for the
use of <B>architextIndex</B> is  as follows:
<P>
<CODE>architextIndex [flags] [index rootname] [file/dir names to index...]</CODE>
<P>
It is also possible to direct a list of files and directories to index
through stdin, with files separated by newlines.  Example usages of
<B>architextIndex</B> are given below.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><CODE>-stem "stemmer name"</CODE><DD>
specifies where to find the stemmer table, defaulted to <B>stem.tbl</B>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>-stop "stop name"</CODE><DD>
is where the indexer finds the stop table files, defaulted to
<B>stop.tbl</B>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>-C "config filename"</CODE><DD>
is an optional argument that tells the indexing executable
<B>architextIndex</B> to use a file that contains any of the arguments
listed above.  If this option is not used, the executable will check
the environment variable <CODE>ARCHITEXT_CONFIG</CODE> for the name of a
configuration file.  If it is undefined, the program will look in the
local directory for the file <B>.architextinit</B>.  Finally, if no config
file is found, then the program will still function as expected,
assuming that all the necessary arguments appear on the command line.
<P>
The intended use of the config file is to define arguments that will
remain static across all your indexing and querying operations.  The
<CODE>-stop</CODE> and <CODE>-stem</CODE> arguments definitely fall into this category,
and the <CODE>-R</CODE> argument could arguably be placed in a config file as
well.
<P>
Any operators repeated on the command line will override those that
appear in a config file.  
<P>
<DT><CODE>-R "rootname"</CODE><DD>
specifies the basename that will be given to the index files.  This is
where architextIndex stores the inverted indices and other associated
data files.  For example, if rootname is <B>dir/foo</B>, the datafiles
will be stored as <B>dir/foo.idx</B>, <B>dir/foo.dat</B>, etc.  
<P>
This flag is optional.  If none is given, the indexing or searching
executable assumes that the first non-flag argument that appears on
the command line is meant to be the rootname.  Thus, the following
commands are semantically identical, and all cause each file under the
directory <B>/data/literature</B> to be indexed, with the index files
given the rootname of <B>foo</B>:
<P>
<CODE>echo "/data/literature" | architextIndex foo</CODE>
<P>
<CODE>echo "/data/literature" | architextIndex -R foo</CODE>
<P>
<CODE>architextIndex -R foo /data/literature</CODE>
<P>
<CODE>architextIndex foo /data/literature</CODE>
<P>
Additionally, suppose you wanted to index three files and a directory:
<B>eenie.html</B>, <B>meenie.html</B>, <B>miney.html</B>, and <B>htmlDir/</B>.  The
following commands are all equivalent (assuming that the file <B>flist</B>
contains the four files listed above, one file per line):
<P>
<CODE>architextIndex foo eenie.html meenie.html miney.html htmlDir</CODE>
<P>
<CODE>architextIndex -R foo eenie.html meenie.html miney.html htmlDir</CODE>
<P>
<CODE>cat flist | architextIndex foo</CODE>
<P>
<CODE>cat | architextIndex -R</CODE>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="Searching from the Command Line"></A><H2>Searching from the Command Line</H2>
As with indexing, querying can also be performed from the command line.
<P>
<A NAME="aquery.pl"></A><H3>aquery.pl</H3>
This perl script takes two arguments.  The first is the collection
name, while the second is your query.  Multiple-word queries should be
enclosed in quotes.  <B>aquery.pl</B> takes care of parsing the information
in the <B>.conf</B> file and invoking the actual search binary with the
proper command-line options.  For example, a search on the database
<B>zymurgy</B> with a query of "top-fermented ales" would be invoked
as follows: 
<P>
<CODE>aquery.pl zymurgy "top-fermented ales"</CODE>
<P>
<A NAME="architextSearch"></A><H3>architextSearch</H3>
This is the binary which actually runs the queries using the indexes
generated by <B>architextIndex</B>.  Syntax for command-line use of the
executable follows:
<P>
<CODE>architextSearch -R "rootnames for index files" -stem "stemmername" -stop "stoppername" -q "query string" -C "config filename"</CODE>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><CODE>-R "rootname"</CODE><DD>
specifies the rootname of the indices the searcher uses.
<P>
<DT><CODE>-stem "stemmer name"</CODE><DD>
specifies where to find the stemmer table, defaulted to <B>stem.tbl</B>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>-stop "stop name"</CODE><DD>
is where the searcher finds the stop table, defaulted to <B>stop.tbl</B>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>-C "config filename"</CODE><DD>
is an optional argument that tells the indexing executable
<B>architextSearch</B> to use a file that contains any of the arguments
listed above.  If this option is not used, the executable will check
the environment variable <CODE>ARCHITEXT_CONFIG</CODE> for the name of a
configuration file.  If it is undefined, the program will look in the
local directory for the file <B>.architextinit</B>.  Finally, if no config
file is found, then the program will still function as expected,
assuming that all the necessary arguments appear on the command line.
<P>
The intended use of the config file is to define arguments that will
remain static across all your indexing and querying operations.  The
<CODE>-stop</CODE> and <CODE>-stem</CODE> arguments definitely fall into this category,
and the <CODE>-R</CODE> argument could arguably be placed in a config file as
well.
<P>
Any operators repeated on the command line will override those that
appear in a config file.  
<P>
<DT><CODE>-q "query string"</CODE><DD>
This is string where the search is entered. 
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="Output from architextSearch"></A><H4>Output from architextSearch</H4>
<B>architextSearch</B> outputs the results of a query to stdout in the
following five column format:
<P>

<A NAME="Creating a CGI Query Script"></A><H3>Creating a CGI Query Script</H3>
It is possible to create and format query pages and scripts manually
what are usable from a Web browser.  The script <B>architextify-html</B>
recognizes certain tags within your html documents, and then converts
the html pages into cgi scripts that match your orignal page yet
support Excite, Inc. searching and subject-grouping functionality.
<P>
<A NAME="architextify-html"></A><H4>architextify-html</H4>
Takes a list of html files as arguments and converts them into cgi
scripts.  There are a number of tags that must appear within your
html page that <B>architextify-html</B> parses and uses to create
<B>.cgi</B> scripts with the appropriate functionality.
<P>
<A NAME="Excite Tags"></A><H4>Excite Tags</H4>
An Excite tag can be placed in an html document which you parse
using <B>architextify-html</B> which uses an extended html syntax to
create a <B>.cgi</B> that will perform queries on an Excite database.
<P>
There are two types of documents that you would want to create scripts
for.  One is for the results of a query and one is for the results of
an ASG (Automatic Subject Grouping).  The motivation for this extended
html syntax is to allow you to tailor the query result and subject
grouping result pages to your needs.  The four tags available in the
extended syntax are the following:
<P>
<PRE>
  &lt;ARCHITEXT-RESULT DB="database name" UNPREFIX="path prefix to remove"
            AHOME="location of Architext html directory (relative to html root)"&gt;
  &lt;ARCHITEXT-MAKE-GATHER DB="database name" UNPREFIX="path prefix to remove"
        AHOME="location of Architext html directory"&gt;
  &lt;ARCHITEXT-GATHER DB="database name" UNPREFIX="path prefix to remove"&gt;
        AHOME="location of Architext html directory"&gt;
  &lt;ARCHITEXT-LEGEND DB="db name" AHOME="location of Architext html directory"&gt;
</PRE>
Placing these tags within your html documents and then using
<B>architextify-html</B> to parse them will create <B>.cgi</B> scripts that
will perform queries and subject grouping and will parse the results
and present them in html format for use with your Web browser.  
<P>
The <CODE>ARCHITEXT-RESULT</CODE> and <CODE>ARCHITEXT-MAKE-GATHER</CODE> flags will appear
in the document that you wish to have become your query script, while
the <CODE>ARCHITEXT-GATHER</CODE> tag will reside in the file that you wish to
become the ASG script.  The <CODE>ARCHITEXT-LEGEND</CODE> tag can appear in
either the query script or the ASG script and will display a legend at
the bottom of a results page explaing the terms and icons used.  The
legend appears by default when the scripts are generated using the
forms interface.
<P>
<A NAME="Sample Query Page"></A><H4>Sample Query Page</H4>
A sample query page appears below.  Note that a simple form invokes
the query by passing the query to the script <B>/cgi-bin/query.cgi</B> as
the <CODE>search</CODE> field in the form.  This page is just standard html and
there is no need to use <B>architextify-html</B> to parse this form.  The
<B>query.cgi</B> script, however, is generated by the user with the help
of <B>architextify-html</B>.  A <A HREF="#Sample Query Script">Sample Query Script</A> appears later in
this document.

Incidentally, the <CODE>ARCHITEXT-MAKE-GATHER</CODE> tag and the form it appears
in are optional in this page, and are only required if the user wishes
to perform ASG (Automatic Subject Grouping) on the results of queries.
After this html page has been <B>architextify-html</B>-ed, it will become
a perl script that obeys the conventions of <B>.cgi</B> scripts.  Note
that the <B>gather.cgi</B> script that is invoked by the form above is
another script that must be generated by the user.  The format for a
<A HREF="#Sample Gather Script">Sample Gather Script</A> is described below.  Once installed in the
<B>cgi-bin</B> directory, queries can be invoked using a standard html
form.  A <A HREF="#Sample Query Page">Sample Query Page</A> is described above.

<A NAME="Moving Your Install Home"></A><H3>Moving Your Install Home</H3>
If you need to move your Excite home for some reason, it is
necessary to change the <CODE>$root</CODE> variable in all the perl scripts
shipped with the distribution.
<P>
<A NAME="scripts-fix-root, scripts-fix-perl"></A><H4>scripts-fix-root, scripts-fix-perl</H4>
scripts-fix-root is a script that will automatically replace the
<CODE>$root</CODE> variable in any perl scripts you specify with a new one.  The
syntax for this is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
  scripts-fix-root &lt;new root dir&gt; &lt;files to update...&gt;
</PRE>
There is also a script <B>scripts-fix-perl</B> available that will update
the <CODE>#!</CODE> notation at the head of each perl script specified on the
command line should the location of your perl interpreter change.
Both of these scripts are used at install time, and you won't likely
need to use them again unless your install home or your perl
interpreter change location.
<P>
<A NAME="install-admin"></A><H4>install-admin</H4>
This script takes the necessary scripts and html files from your
install home, places the cgi scripts into your cgi-bin directory, and
places the html into the Architext config root you specified at
install time.  This script is also used by the install script, and
unless you move the location of the Architext directory under your
html root, you won't need to use this script.  Usage is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
  install-admin &lt;Architext config directory&gt; &lt;cgi-bin directory&gt;
