<p> It is possible to set up a recurring indexing process using
the <code>cron</code> facility, which allows you to run a command
at specific times.  To invoke an indexing process, 
use the <b>aindex.pl</b> script, which
can be found in the directory in which you installed Excite for Web Servers.
<p> The usage for <b>aindex.pl</b> is as follows:
<ul>
<pre>
aindex.pl [collection name]
</pre>
</ul>

<p> So, for example, if you wanted to index the collection
'webdata' every night at midnight, and your software was
installed in <b>/usr/local/etc/architext</b>, you would need
to add the following line to your crontab file using the
<code>crontab</code> command:
<ul>
<pre>
0 0 * * * /usr/local/etc/architext/aindex.pl webdata
</pre>
</ul>

Be sure that the <code>cron</code> job will be run under a user
id that has read and write privileges to the directory that 
your indexes are stored in.

<p> For more detailed information on the use of <code>cron</code>
and <code>crontab</code>, check your system's <code>man</code>
pages using the <code>man</code> command.
