Installing Excite for Web Servers
---------------------------------

Thank you for downloading Excite for Web Servers!

NOTE: This distribution contains the patch for the CGI security hole
described in CERT* Vendor Initiated Bulletin VB-98.01.  For more
information, please see ftp.cert.org/pub/cert_bulletins/VB-98.01.excite

To begin the installation process, you must be logged in as root (or
superuser).

*** Installation will NOT change any of your system configuration files. ***
 
Installation will create two directories.  One will be a directory you
specify in which the index and search applications and the index files
will be stored, and the second will be a directory you specify that
must be beneath your Web server's HTML root, in which documentation
and icons will be stored.  Finally, several scripts prefixed with 'AT-'
will be installed into your cgi-bin directory.

To get started, invoke the script 'sh ./install-Excite' from the directory 
containing the compressed archive file 'Excite.tar.Z'

The installation script will lead you step-by-step through
the process.

Thank You,
Excite, Inc.

NOTE:  If you are installing over an old version of the software,
be advised that the format for the 'ExclusionRules' file has 
changed.  However, your old ExclusionRules file will continue
to function properly.
