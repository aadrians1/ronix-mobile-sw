<TD>Santa Clara, Calif. - June 8, 1998 - Scenix Semiconductor, Inc. today announced that its SX Series high-performance 8-bit microcontroller (MCU) family will now be available in South East Asian markets from technical distributors and stocking representatives in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Japan.  The Scenix representatives will perform both distribution and OEM support functions at the local level within their respective territories.</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD>Scenix MCUs are intended for use as embedded controllers in a wide range of consumer, industrial, telecommunications, office automation and automotive products.  The Asia Pacific region is one of the principal design and manufacturing centers for such products, and the representative organizations were chosen because of their significant technical expertise and customer knowledge.  They will work with the Scenix staff to ensure full support to customers and potential customers.</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD>"The Asian market has enormous potential in consumer electronics, where innovative design and flexibility without added cost are key, and in such other areas as telephony and PC peripherals," said Steve Leung, president and CEO of Scenix.  "The SX Series MCU is a great platform to build families of such products on.  With its ability to implement peripherals in software, electronics OEMs can standardize on a single type of MCU for multiple products, simplifying the design effort and shortening time to market."</TD>

<TD><B>About the SX Series</B><BR>

The SX Series is a family of 8-bit MCUs that run at up to 50 MHz and deliver 50 MIPS (million instructions per second) of processing power.  This unequaled performance, coupled with on-chip EEPROM-based flash, enables system designers to use "Virtual Peripherals," which are software implementations of functions that otherwise require dedicated and costly hardware, such as timers, UARTs, A/D converters, and I/O controllers.  The software code for these functions occupies a small portion of the on-board flash EEPROM and requires relatively little of the MCU's resources for execution.</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD>To enable this Virtual Peripheral approach, Scenix incorporated a number of innovative features into the SX Series.  A four-stage (fetch-decode-execute-write back) pipeline executes one instruction per clock cycle, yielding a 20 ns instruction cycle when running at 50 MHz.  (Branch instructions require three clocks, since the pipeline must refill.)  To match this performance, Scenix developed an extremely fast on-chip Flash/EEPROM program memory and correspondingly fast SRAM register file.  All MCU instructions are fixed-length (12 bits), and partially executed branch instructions can be canceled to enable immediate response when an interrupt is detected.  This combination of features yields an interrupt response time that is always 60 ns at 50MHz, which is superior to the performance of higher priced and less flexible 16-bit MCUs and DSPs.</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD>To complement the Virtual Peripherals, the SX includes the following standard features on-chip:  4 MHz programmable oscillator; user-programmable three-level brown-out reset; power-on reset; watchdog timer with RC oscillator; and multi-input wakeups.  Even when using only the on-board clock, SX Series performance exceeds that of many older 8-bit MCUs, which require multiple clock cycles for each instruction.  An on-chip analog comparator is also provided, which designers can use with other hardwired components or software techniques to provide potentiometer or temperature sensing capabilities.</TD>

</TR>



<TR>

<TD>The SX architecture contains 43 instructions, including 33 that are designed to be object-code compatible with the PIC16C5X(r) series MCUs, enabling designers familiar with PIC to quickly be productive working with the SX Series.  However, the SX Series is truly a platform for entirely new designs that leverage the unprecedented performance and affordability of the first 8-bit MCU designed to fully leverage deep-sub-micron manufacturing technology.</TD>

<TD><B>About Scenix Semiconductor</B><BR>
        Scenix Semiconductor, Inc. is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif. Founded 
        in 1996, the company's mission is to deliver high-performance, cost-effective, 
        easy-to-use single-chip solutions for embedded systems. Scenix announced 
        the SX Series family of microcontrollers in August 1997 and shipped the 
        first production parts in late December 1997. Additional information on
