<TD>Santa Clara, Calif. - May 18, 1998 - Scenix Semiconductor, Inc. today announced that it has completed agreements with a network of technical distributors and stocking representatives throughout Western Europe, giving it broad coverage in that region for its SX Series high-performance 8-bit microcontrollers (MCUs).  The distributors and representatives will perform both distribution and OEM support functions at the local level within their respective territories.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Scenix MCUs are used in a wide range of embedded system applications, including consumer, industrial, telecommunications, office automation and automotive products.  European manufacturers are major players in these markets, and the representative organizations were chosen because of their customer knowledge as well as their outstanding technical capabilities.  They will work with the Scenix staff to ensure full support to customers and potential customers.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>"Scenix is looking at Europe to be a major market for the SX Series microcontroller," said Steve Leung, president and CEO of Scenix.  "Since we introduced the SX Series in late 1997, we have received an overwhelming response from potential European customers, particularly in the industrial control and telecommunications areas, who recognize that the SX and our virtual peripherals concept are ideally suited to their markets and applications.  Building up a sales and support infrastructure in Europe will guarantee first-class local support to our customers there."</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Roland Chu, vice president of sales at Scenix, added, "We anticipate that sales into Europe will ultimately represent up to one-third of our revenues.   To provide comprehensive support and service throughout this market, we're partnering with first-line companies that have demonstrated technical proficiency and are well-suited to helping customers develop systems based on Scenix microcontrollers."</TD>

 "Becoming a Scenix stocking rep is a perfect fit with our growth direction," said Ralph Thompson, Product Manager at Ambar Components Ltd. in the U.K.  "We've just put in place an in-house design center that will let us help our customers with their product development work.  This is a natural fit for the type of embedded applications envisioned for the SX Series MCU, and we're pleased to be able to offer that support."</TD>

<TD><B>About the SX Series</B><BR>
The SX Series is a family of 8-bit MCUs that run at up to 50 MHz and deliver 50 MIPS (million instructions per second) of processing power.  This unequaled performance, coupled with on-chip EEPROM-based flash, enables system designers to use "virtual peripherals," which are software implementations of functions that otherwise require dedicated and costly hardware, such as timers, UARTs, A/D converters, and I/O controllers.  The software code for these functions occupies a small portion of the on-board flash EEPROM and requires relatively little of the MCU's resources for execution.  The SX architecture contains 43 instructions, including 33 that are designed to be object-code compatible with the PIC16C5X(r) series MCUs, enabling designers familiar with PIC to quickly be productive working with the SX Series.  However, the SX Series is truly a platform for entirely new designs that leverage the unprecedented performance and affordability of the first 8-bit MCU designed to fully leverage deep-sub-micron manufacturing technology.</TD>

<TD><B>About Scenix Semiconductor</B><BR>
        Scenix Semiconductor, Inc. is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif. Founded 
        in 1996, the company's mission is to deliver high-performance, cost-effective, 
        easy-to-use single-chip solutions for embedded systems. Scenix announced 
        the SX Series family of microcontrollers in August 1997 and shipped the 
        first production parts in late December 1997. In early 1998, the company 
        completed a $7.6 million round of venture financing. Additional information 
        on Scenix and the SX Series products can be found on the Web, at <A HREF="http://www.scenix.com"><font color="#FF0000">http://www.scenix.com.</font></A></TD>
