Complete Development System Now Available To Embedded Control Designers</CENTER></TD>

<TR>
<TD>Santa Clara, Calif. - December 15, 1997 - Scenix Semiconductor, Inc. today announced that it has shipped the first production parts in the SX Series microcontroller (MCU) family.  With performance at up to 50 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second) and  2K x 12 bits of on-chip Flash EEPROM in the initial production parts, the SX Series delivers a new level of speed and in-system programmability to the 8-bit MCU market.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Scenix has shipped the production units of its SX Series MCUs to Parallax, Inc., provider of the SX-Key(tm) development system.  The on-schedule production of the SX Series enables Parallax to ship its SX-Key development system to embedded application developers.  This complete in-circuit development system allows designers to use the production SX Series chips to test and debug new system designs and program the on-chip Flash EEPROM without special tools or  bond-out chips.</TD>
</TR>  

<TR>
<TD><B>Power Drives Flexibility</B><BR>
The SX Series MCU delivers up to 50 MIPS of processing power when running at 50 MHz.  This unequaled performance enables system designers to use "virtual peripherals," which are implementations in software of functions previously requiring dedicated and costly hardware.  The software code for these functions occupies a small portion of the on-board Flash EEPROM and requires relatively little of the MCU's resources for execution.</TD>
</TR>  

<TR>
<TD>The flexibility provided by in-system programmable Flash EEPROM offers a number of advantages compared to typical one-time-programmable or masked ROM 8-bit MCUs.  Software revisions can take place at any stage in the application development or system production cycle, and even be made remotely to installed systems via modem or other communication links.  The result is a time-to-market advantage and flexibility that contributes to inventory reduction, allowing system vendors to quickly update programming in response to design change requirements.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>To enable the virtual peripheral approach, Scenix incorporated a number of innovative features into the SX Series.  A four-stage - fetch-decode-execute-write back - pipeline executes one instruction per clock cycle, yielding a 20 ns instruction cycle when running at 50 MHz.  (Branch instructions require three clocks, since the pipeline must refill.)  To match this performance, Scenix developed an extremely fast (12 ns access time) embedded Flash EEPROM program memory and correspondingly fast SRAM register file.  All MCU instructions are fixed-length (12 bits), and partially executed branch instructions can be canceled to enable immediate response when an interrupt is detected.  This combination of features yields a deterministic interrupt response time of 60 ns for internal events, and 100 ns for external events, which is superior to the performance of higher-priced and less flexible 16-bit MCUs and DSPs.</TD>
</TR>  

<TR>
<TD>To complement the virtual peripherals, the SX includes the following standard features on-chip:  4 MHz (+3% accuracy) programmable oscillator; programmable three-level brown-out reset; Power-On Reset; Watchdog Timer with RC oscillator; and Multi-Input Wakeups.  Even when using only the on-board clock, SX Series performance exceeds that of many older 8-bit MCUs, which require multiple clock cycles for each instruction.  An on-chip analog comparator is also provided, which designers can use with other hardwired components or software techniques to provide  potentiometer or temperature sensing capabilities.</TD>
</TR>  

<TR>
<TD><B>More Than An 8-bit Upgrade</B><BR>
The SX architecture contains 43 instructions, including 33 that are designed to be object-code compatible with the PIC16C5X(r) series MCUs, enabling designers familiar with PIC to quickly be productive working with the SX Series.  However, the SX Series is truly a platform for entirely new designs that leverage the unprecedented performance and affordability of the first 8-bit MCU designed for manufacture using deep sub-micron CMOS process technology.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Initial evaluators report that SX Series MCUs provide from 10 to 50 times the performance of other 8-bit MCUs, with lower power consumption and reduced EMI.  Consequently, the SX Series is suitable for many applications previously considered to be the realm of 16- and 32-bit MCUs, low-end DSP and custom ASIC designs, which may be up to 75 percent more expensive in system implementations.  In all applications, the SX Series is designed to meet the principal requirements of time-to-market, system cost and flexibility, and this is reflected in the system development tools available from third-party suppliers.</TD>
</TR>  

<TR>
<TD>The SX-Key is a complete development system, designed and manufactured by Parallax, Inc., of Rocklin, Calif. (916/624-8333, <www.parallaxinc.com>), priced at just $249.  The system includes a tiny (0.5" x 1.5") in-circuit programmer with a 6-ft serial cable, PC-based assembler and debugger, demonstration board, two SX Series MCUs, and manual.  The SX-Key can be used as both a software development and in-system programming tool.  Higher volume gang programmers will also be available from third-party suppliers in early 1998.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Byte Craft Limited of Waterloo, Ontario (519/888-6911, <www.bytecraft.com>), provides a  code development system for $795 (DOS version) or $1,595 (Windows NT version).  The SXC Code Development System includes a C Compiler and Macro Assembler to generate small, fast and efficient code.</TD>
</TR>   

<TR>
<TD><B>Pricing Meets Volume Market Requirements</B><BR>
The first production SX Series MCUs, the SX18AC and SX28AC, are 18- or 28-pin package (DIP, SSOP and SOIC), 2048 word (x12) devices.  Priced at $3.49 (in 1,000 unit quantity), the  parts meet the form factor and cost constraints of high-volume consumer, office automation, telecommunication, automotive and industrial applications.  The initial parts are specified to operate from 3.3 to 6.25 V.  Scenix plans to introduce lower voltage products in the second half of 1998, as well as parts with different on-chip memory configurations.</TD>

      <TD>Scenix Semiconductor, Inc. is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif. Founded 
        in 1996, the company's mission is to deliver high-performance, cost-effective, 
        easy-to-use single-chip solutions for embedded systems. Scenix announced 
        the SX Series family of microcontrollers in August 1997. In November 1997, 
        the company completed a $3.85 million round of venture financing. Additional 
        information on Scenix and the SX Series products can be found on the Web,
