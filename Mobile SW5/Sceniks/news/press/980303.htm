<TD>Santa Clara, Calif. - March 3, 1998 - Scenix Semiconductor, Inc. today announced that it has completed building an extensive network of sales representatives throughout the U.S., giving it complete coast-to-coast coverage for its SX Series high-performance 8-bit microcontroller (MCU) family.  The representative organizations bring significant technical and customer knowledge to the sales function, and will work with the Scenix staff to ensure full support to customers and potential customers.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>"Our rep list contains 14 of the leading organizations in North America.  This will give us a depth and breadth of sales and support coverage that we could not achieve with an internal staff alone," said Roland Chu, Scenix' vice president of sales.  "These are all first-line companies, and they're very much in tune with our marketing strategy and philosophy.  In addition, they're all very technically proficient, which is particularly critical in supporting the embedded applications for which the SX Series is intended.  We look forward to working with our new partners to penetrate our target markets, and anticipate a period of major growth with their help."</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>"Taking on the Scenix line is very exciting for us," said Mike Porter, vice president of sales at Dynamic Technical Sales, Inc.  "The SX Series technology is very versatile, making it suitable for a wide variety of customers and applications.  In fact, customer interest in the SX Series is far superior to other lines we've introduced to our customer base."</TD>

At VISTAssociates, president Paul Kerrigan said, "We're confident that partnering with Scenix will produce significant design wins and revenue growth.  They're in the process of bringing out the highest performance and, with its on-chip EEPROM-based flash, the most flexible embedded 8-bit MCU in the industry.  We already know how extremely attractive that's going to be to a large number of our customers.  It's the kind of situation where we'll be able to help them grow, and to grow right along with them."</TD>

<TD><B>About the SX Series</B><BR>
The SX Series is a family of 8-bit MCUs that run at up to 50 MHz and deliver 50 MIPS (million instructions per second) of processing power.  This unequaled performance enables system designers to use "virtual peripherals," which are software implementations of functions that otherwise require dedicated and costly hardware, such as timers, UARTs, A/D converters, and I/O controllers.  The software code for these functions occupies a small portion of the on-board
flash EEPROM and requires relatively little of the MCU's resources for execution.  The SX architecture contains 43 instructions, including 33 that are designed to be object-code compatible with the PIC16C5X(r) series MCUs, enabling designers familiar with PIC to quickly be productive working with the SX Series.  However, the SX Series is truly a platform for entirely new designs that leverage the unprecedented performance and affordability of the first 8-bit MCU designed to fully leverage deep-sub-micron manufacturing technology.</TD>
