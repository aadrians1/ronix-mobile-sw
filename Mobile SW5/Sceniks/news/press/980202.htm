<TD>Santa Clara, Calif. - February 2, 1998 - Scenix Semiconductor, Inc. today announced that it has signed EBV Electronics of San Diego, Calif., as its North American distribution partner.  The agreement covers all EBV locations, and makes EBV responsible for distributing the Scenix SX Series high-performance 8-bit microcontroller (MCU) family, and for providing design support for customers developing SX-based systems.</TD>
<TR>
	
<TR>
<TD>EBV Electronics is a stocking, franchised distributor of semiconductor devices that concentrates on the technical needs of customers through an engineering-centered sales and service approach, backed by world-class order fulfillment programs.  In addition to customer design support, EBV will provide Scenix with inventory management, automated warehousing, auto-replenishment and EDI ordering.</TD>
</TR>	

<TR>
<TD>"EBV is exactly the distribution partner we were looking for to help us grow our design base and open doors with new customers in North America," said Steve Leung, chief executive officer and co-founder of Scenix Semiconductor.  "Not only will they stock and distribute our SX Series MCUs, but they'll be able to use their engineering-focused approach to help customers in the development phase of designs.  This is particularly critical in the case of the embedded applications for which the SX Series is intended.  We're looking forward to working with EBV to build market penetration for the SX Series."</TD>
</TR>
	
<TR>
<TD>The SX Series is a family of 8-bit MCUs that deliver up to 50 MIPS of processing power.  This unequaled performance enables system designers to use "virtual peripherals," which are software implementations of functions that otherwise require dedicated and costly hardware, such as timers, UARTs, A/D converters, and I/O controllers.  The software code for these functions occupies a small portion of the on-board flash EEPROM and requires relatively little of the MCU's resources for execution.  Scenix shipped the first production parts in the SX Series family in late December 1997.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>"Taking on the Scenix line is very exciting for us," said Jim Burdick, president and CEO of EBV Electronics.  "Scenix technology is very promising and offers enormous growth potential.  With up to ten times the performance of other 8-bit MCUs, the SX Series helps our customers address applications previously in the realm of much-more-expensive 16- and 32-bit MCUs."</TD>
</TR>

<TR><TD><B>About the SX Series</B><BR>
Running at up to 50 MHz and providing 2K x 12 bits of on-chip flash EEPROM in the initial production parts, the SX series delivers a new level of speed and in-system programmability to the 8-bit MCU market.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>The SX architecture contains 43 instructions, including 33 that are designed to be object-code compatible with the PIC16C5X(r) series MCUs, enabling designers familiar with PIC to quickly be productive working with the SX Series.  However, the SX Series is truly a platform for entirely new designs that leverage the unprecedented performance and affordability of the first 8-bit MCU designed to fully leverage deep-sub-micron manufacturing technology.</TD>
