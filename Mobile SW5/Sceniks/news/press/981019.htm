<TD>Santa Clara, Calif. - Oct. 19, 1998 - Scenix Semiconductor, Inc. today announced the addition of a 100 MHz version of the SX Series 8-bit microcontroller to its product portfolio.  The new SX18/28AC100 MCU delivers up to 100 MIPS (million instructions per second) of processing power.  It is capable of executing complex digital signal processing (DSP) and similar parallel processing tasks in software, making it an ideal low-cost replacement for medium-performance DSP or programmable logic ICs in a wide range of embedded applications.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Operating at up to 100 MHz, the SX18/28AC100 executes one instruction per clock cycle, giving it a data throughput of 100 MIPS with a 10-nanosecond (ns) instruction cycle.  A proprietary on-chip flash/EEPROM program memory having a 10 ns access time supports the single-cycle execution.  A deterministic interrupt response architecture ensures that all interrupts are serviced in only 30 ns (three cycles), which eliminates jitter and, in conjunction with the processing power, makes it possible to execute even complex functions as software modules, or "Virtual Peripherals."</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b>Price and Availability</b></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>The 100 MIPS SX18AC100 and SX28AC100 have 2K x 12 words of flash/EEPROM.  They are offered in 18- or 28-pin PDIP and small-outline (SOIC) packages, and are priced in the $5.00 range for small quantities.  They are now available in sample quantities, with production-level availability planned for the middle of the first quarter of 1999.
Development tools, including a PC-based assembler and debugger, are also now available.

<TD><b>Extending the SX Series Product Offering</b></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>The SX18/28AC100 extends the industry's most powerful family of 8-bit embedded controllers to a new level of cost-effective performance.  Scenix Semiconductor began volume shipment of its 50 MHz/50 MIPS SX Series products earlier this year.  The company has also made Virtual Peripherals available to support such applications as modems, which allows electronics OEMs to significantly reduce total system cost and part count in embedded product designs.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>"The success of our initial 50 MHz products demonstrates that the embedded control market is primed to take advantage of very high-performance 8-bit MCUs," said Steve Leung, president and chief executive officer of Scenix Semiconductor.  "Doubling the clock speed enables an entirely new class of applications for the SX Series architecture, and provides system designers with a family of solutions unmatched by any other supplier of 8-bit, or even 16-bit, products."</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b>Extending the Power of Virtual Peripherals</b></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>By combining processing power with on-chip programmable memory, Scenix was one of the first MCU manufacturers to enable implementation of Virtual Peripherals using 8-bit MCUs.  This software module approach decreases required silicon real estate and reduces custom silicon development, while shortening design time and achieving faster time to market.  </TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>The 100 MIPS performance of the SX18/28AC100 extends the Virtual Peripheral capability to include complex DSP-type functions, such as digital filtering, in software, which no other 8-bit MCU can do.  This makes the SX18/28AC100 ideal for high-end telecommunications and telephonic applications, and for use as a replacement for FPGAs (field-programmable logic devices), PLDs (programmable logic devices) and medium-performance DSPs.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>DSPs are characterized by the use of parallel processing techniques to achieve high performance levels.  These parallel operations have been beyond 8-bit MCUs because such controllers need to implement functions in hardware and are limited because they have single-bus architectures.  The Scenix SX18/28AC100, however, can execute DSP-type functions as Virtual Peripherals, eliminating the bus-limitation problem.  For example, it can perform a fourth-order finite-duration impulse response (FIR) digital filter function in less than 10 ms, and can perform an infinite-duration impulse response (IIR) filter function in less than 30 ms.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>The SX18/28AC100 is also an ideal vehicle for software implementation of functions normally incorporated as hardware in FPGAs and PLDs.  For example, a vector multiplier, which sums four products, typically occupies about 30 percent of the logic area in an FPGA.  The function can be implemented in software using the 100 MIPS SX MCU, eliminating both the silicon requirement and the time needed to develop it.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><b>Achieving 100 MIPS</b></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>The SX Series was designed for manufacture in a 0.5-micron process, making it the first 8-bit MCU architecture to take full advantage of deep-sub-micron geometries.  Other 8-bit products available today are a geometry shrink or other modification of existing, years-old architectures.  The SX Series includes a RISC-like instruction set and modified Harvard memory organization, with a four-stage (fetch-decode-execute-write back) pipeline that executes one instruction per clock cycle.  The pipeline incorporates features, such as "bypassing" (sending the output of the result stage directly to the ALU to allow the next instruction to execute immediately), that have been shown to improve throughput without compromising cost.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>Also contributing to the SX Series high performance level is the use of a deterministic interrupt scheme.  With other 8-bit MCUs, interrupt response time is unpredictable because it depends upon what instruction is being executed when the interrupt occurs.  This introduces "jitter" into the system that imposes resolution and SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) limits on performance.  The SX Series has a fixed, or deterministic, three-cycle interrupt response time that eliminates all of these issues.  For the SX18/28AC100, the deterministic interrupt response time is only 30 ns.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>To match this performance, Scenix developed an extremely fast (10 ns access time) on-chip flash/EEPROM program memory and correspondingly fast SRAM register file.  The flexibility provided by in-system programmable flash/EEPROM offers a number of advantages compared to typical one-time-programmable (OTP) or masked ROM 8-bit MCUs.  Software revisions can take place at any stage in the application development or system production cycle, and even be made remotely to installed systems via modem or other communication links.  The results are shorter time-to-market and flexibility that contributes to inventory reduction, allowing system vendors to quickly update programming in response to design change requirements.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>"We anticipated the need for a 100 MIPS 8-bit MCU at the beginning of our first design, and designed the SX Series architecture to scale up to faster clock rates for it," said Chuck Cheng, Scenix vice president of engineering.  "When we had gained experience with the original 50 MIPS part, we could verify performance over temperature range and optimize the flash/EEPROM for 10 ns performance to support a 100 MHz clock to create the SX18/28AC100."</TD>

Development tools are available from Scenix, Parallax, Inc., and, in Asia, from COMFILE, the Scenix representative in Korea.  Virtual Peripherals are available as downloadable files from the Scenix and Parallax Web sites.</TD>
