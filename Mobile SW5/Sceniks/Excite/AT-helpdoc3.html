Excite for Web Servers provides a few basic features that allow for
searching and indexing of files with custom document formats.  By
using these features, a user can define a string that acts as a
document delimiter, in case there are multiple documents per file.
Also, a string can be defined that sets off the title in each
document, so that the title can be displayed in the results list.
<P>
In order to allow a custom format to be defined, two variable's values
must be changed:
<P>
<PRE>
  * C&lt;$custom_format&gt; in F&lt;afeatures.pl&gt; must be set to 1, and
  * C&lt;$restrict_beneath_document_root&gt; must be set to 0, to allow
    documents that appear outside the Web server's document root to be
    indexed.
</PRE>
<A NAME="custom_format"></A><H3>custom_format</H3>
Setting <CODE>$custom_format</CODE> to 1 notifies Excite for Web Servers that it
should deal with all non-HTML files in this collection as
custom-format files.
<P>
<A NAME="restrict_beneath_document_root"></A><H3>restrict_beneath_document_root</H3>
Excite for Web Servers knows how to serve custom-format documents only
when they appear outside the Web server's document root.  To serve
these documents, EWS uses CGI scripts which grab and then output their
text.
<P>
Setting <CODE>$restrict_beneath_document_root</CODE> to 0 is necessary as it
relaxes the restriction of Excite for Web Servers that the documents
it serves appear beneath the server's document root.
<P>
You should note that there are some drawbacks to this method of
serving documents.  First, there's some extra computational overhead
in invoking CGI scripts.  Second, relative-pathname hyperlinks may not
work.  And third, the loading of images doesn't work, since the text
of documents served in this manner by Excite for Web Servers are
contained within &ltPRE&gt tags.
<P>
<A NAME="Defining Custom Formats"></A><H2>Defining Custom Formats</H2>
Once the variables mentioned above have been appropriately set in
<B>afeatures.pl</B>, it is possible to define document and title
delimiters.  This is done during collection configuration using
<B>AT-config.cgi</B>, reachable from the main administration page,
<B>AT-admin.cgi</B>.
<P>
<A NAME="Document Delimiter"></A><H3>Document Delimiter</H3>
This field defines a string that separates documents within a
single file.  This is useful when multiple documents per file
appear.
<P>
<A NAME="Title Delimiter"></A><H3>Title Delimiter</H3>
In many custom formats, the document's title is set off by a certain
string.  By defining this string, it is possible to cause Excite for
Web Servers to extract the title for display in the query result list.
<P>
Below follows an example custom format:
<P>
<PRE>
  AU Doe, John
  TI The History of Technology
  DA July 1st, 1995.
  AB A short 200-word history of technology.
  First came fire, then the wheel ...
  .
  .
  *****
  AU Doe, Jane
  TI The History of Mathematics
  DA July 2nd, 1995.
  AB A short 200-word history of mathematics.
  First came one, then two, ...
  .
  .
  *****
</PRE>
In the example above, the <B>Document Delimiter</B> would be <CODE>'*****'</CODE>
and the <B>Title Delimiter</B> would be <CODE>'TI'</CODE>.  Therefore, when the text
of each document is retrieved by Excite for Web Servers, there would
be two documents in this example, and the titles presented in a result
list would be <I>The History of Technology</I> and <I>The History of
Mathematics</I>.
<P>
<A NAME="Indexing Custom Formats"></A><H2>Indexing Custom Formats</H2>
After the <B>Document Delimiter</B> and <B>Title Delimiter</B> have been
defined, one can then index the documents which are in that format.
<P>
As explained above, if you wish to serve the text of these documents
using Excite for Web Servers, you must store the custom format files
in directories <I>outside</I> of the Web server's document root.  Only
when documents are stored outside the Web server's document root does
Excite for Web Servers know to use CGI scripts to access the text of
those documents.  This is especially important when a
multiple-document-per-file format is being used, since otherwise a
link to the file would return the text of many documents at once.
<P>
Finally, make sure that the <A HREF="AT-helpdoc.html">IndexFilter</A>
attribute is set to index text files as well as HTML files.  When the
<CODE>$custom_mode</CODE> variable is enabled in <B>afeatures.pl</B>, the indexer
assumes that all documents that are not HTML documents are in the
custom format.
<P>
