What is Windows Commander?

Windows Commander is a file manager for Windows, a tool like the Explorer or
file manager, which comes with windows. But Windows Commander uses a different
approach: it has two fixed windows, which makes copying files much easier.
Wincmd exists in two versions, 16 and 32 bit. While the 16-bit version runs
fine also in 32-bit Windows, the 32-bit version cannot be used in Windows 3.1.

Windows Commander is shareware. The shareware version is freely distributable, 
as long as it is unchanged!

Removing Windows Commander: Double click wcuninst.exe !

Installation BY HAND: Just copy the files to a directory on your hard disk.
Unpack the files install.cab and installe.cab with a cab unpacker (like
CABVIEW from Microsoft) to an empty dir, like c:\wincmd . Then move all
files with the extension .pif into the Windows directory. They let external
packers run in a DOS window instead of full screen.

Removal by hand:If you remove the program (wincmd dir), also delete the files
wincmd.ini, wcx_ftp.ini and noclose.pif in your Windows directory!
