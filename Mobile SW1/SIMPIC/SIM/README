This package contains source code in C to programs that read information
from a GSM SIM. They work with Linux. Programs are as follows:

a8crack       resolve the secret number on a SIM using COMP128
a8cracktest   a test program to verify that the secret recovery algorithm works
phonebook     dump the phonebook entries on a SIM
cardtest      dump the ATR and reader version string

With the exception of a8cracktest, these programs will only work
with an AMC151 reader. The AMC151 will be accessed thru /dev/amc151
which should be a symbolic link to the serial port the device is
connected to.
