   Version 1.55 - a "bug-fixing & updates" release

   1. Changes in RAR_SITE.TXT. Internet registration added (see files
      INTERNET.REG and INTERNET.TXT for details).

   2. Speed increasing on 'skipping' operation while extracting files
      from solid archives.

   3. Speed increasing on 'Delete' and 'Update' operations in solid
      archives.

   4. In case of starting RAR to enter the archive (with archive name as
      command line parameter), pressing <Esc> key quits to DOS instead
      of switching to file mode.

   5. Some incompatibility problems on network drives has been fixed.

   6. Fixed a bug in Installation SFX caused incorrect character
      variable assignment.

   7. Fixed a bug in common SFX caused a wrong exit code (ERRORLEVEL).


   Version 1.54

   1. A new, alternative SFX module has been implemented - the Installation
      SFX. The command 'S' and the switch '-sfx' may now be followed by
      a file name, denoting the file containing the required SFX module.
      See the Installation SFX documentation, SFX.DOC, for more details.
      Recently modified (since beta version) box and menu commands. Their
      screen coordinates are now processing relatively to current window.

   2. An archive conversion tool, RCVT, is now included in the package.

   3. The switch '-av-' has been enhanced to provide a dual-purpose
      function.  When unpacking an archive it will disable the checking
      of Authenticity Verification information, when packing an archive, 
      it will inhibit the addition of Authenticity Verification 
      information, overriding the configuration default.

   4. In full-screen mode, new function key combinations have been
      added:  Alt-F4 initiates the creation of an SFX-archive and
      Alt-F9 initiates the creation of a Solid SFX-archive.

   5. The facility has been added to allow the user to 'walk' through
      archive volumes in full screen mode.  The Left-Arrow key may be
      used to change to the previous volume and the Right-Arrow key
      for the next volume.

   6. The switch '-dh' has been added to "Disable file sharing".  This
      will help when accessing files open by other applications on
      networks or in a multi-tasking environment.

   7. The switch '-vd' "Erase disk contents before creating volume" has
      been added.  All files and directories on the target disk will be 
      erased when '-vd' is used.  The switch applies only to removable
      media, the hard disk cannot be erased using this switch.

   8. The new facility was added - in the '-v<size>' switch the <size>
      parameter now may be followed by the 'b' character meaning the 
      size of created volumes in bytes entered. For instance you may
      enter '-v362496b' to provide volume of 362496 bytes length creation.


   Version 1.53

   1. RAR now utilizes Expanded memory (EMS 4.0).  Using EMS memory 
      decreases the minimum memory required, to create, update and
      extract from archives, by 64 Kb.  The option "Use expanded 
      memory" has been added to the configuration and a switch '-ems-' 
      has been added to - "disable EMS usage."

   2. The option "Keep backup archive" is removed as the switch '-b'
      still exists.

   3. Adding files to the archive using the command line now requires
      only 283 Kb of RAM with using EMS enabled and 347 Kb without EMS.

   4. Minor speed increasing on packing and unpacking operations.

   5. Due to memory limitations, backward compatibility has reduced
      capability.  For archives created by RAR versions prior to 1.50,
      only extract and test operations are possible.

   6. The switch '-$[<drive>]' - "provide volume label support for the
      current or specified drive" - allows pack and unpack volume labels.

   7. The switch '-av' - "disable AV check" has been added.

   8. The switch '-ds' - "disable name sort for Solid archive" has
      been added.  It could be used, while experimenting, in order to
      achieve the highest compression ratio dependent upon the order 
      of files in a solid archive.

   9. The switch '-ialt' disables the changing, by pressing the left 
      Alt key, the context function key information in the bottom line 
      of the screen (in full-screen mode).  This helps some users who 
      wished to use certain TSRs while in RAR.  The action of the left
      and right function keys are in other respects, unchanged.
      
  10. The switch '-z<file>' used in conjunction with commands 'A','F',
      'U','M','C' will add archive comments from the specified file. 
      This gives more flexibility than the old combination '=<file>', 
      due to the fact that the new switch can be placed in any
      position on the command line and allows adding comments to 
      already existing archives.  The old style,'=<file>', still
      exists for compatibility.

  11. In full-screen mode, while in a directory, function key <F8>,
      or the <Del> key, performs a deletion of marked files.  The
      repair function has been moved to Alt-<F8>. 

  12. An improvement in the capabilities of the SFX module to handle
      broken archives.

  13. The unRAR utility source code in the unRAR 1.03 SFX-package.

  14. The SFX module now quits with non-zero ERRORLEVEL when an
      error is occured during self-extraction procedure.


   Version 1.52

   1. The modification of solid archives is now implemented.
      Option "Always make solid" has been added to the configuration
      menu, if set then RAR will always create solid archives.
      The update and delete file operations for solid archives
      require 520 Kb of RAM. Adding files to a solid archive
      requires 420 Kb of RAM.  Adding files to a solid archive is
      significantly faster than updating or deleting.

   2. The RAM requirement for extracting files from an
      archive has been reduced and is approximately 265 Kb. To
      start RAR you need only 230 Kb of memory. The RAM requirement
      for creating and updating archives has not changed
      (approximately 420 Kb).

   3. The switch '-tk' - "do not modify archive date" has been
      added.

   4. The switch '-tl' - "set archive date as the date of
      newest file" has been added.

   5. It is now possible to give several switches, of the form
      '-x<name>' ("exclude files") on the same command line.

   6. The SFX archive module now can be handled by switches:
      -t - "test SFX archive" and -v - "view archive content".

   7. Temporary files will no longer be created while extracting
      and testing files in the archive if the operation can be 
      performed in RAM.

   8. Temporary file names are all of the form "$RAR$_*.*".

   9. FREE unRAR utility now provided within RAR distributive.


   Version 1.51

   1. Sound effects are added with option Sound in configuration.

   2. CRC errors may be logged to a file RAR.LOG - option Log
      errors to file in configuration. This feature is available only
      in the registered version.

   3. Pressing Alt-J in full-screen mode while archive processing
      and in menus starts DOS shell. This feature is available only in
      the registered version.

   4. Commands 'C' and 'CF' could not be processed with archives
      created by RAR versions prior to 1.50.


   Version 1.50.2 beta

   1. Fixed bug in command 'x' with switches -f -u.

   2. Interface advances:
      - clicking mouse key at top of the screen causes to
        change current disk;
      - Ctrl-\ causes entering root directory (changing
        current directory to root).


   Version 1.50.1 beta

   1. Packing when insufficient memory bug fixed.


   Version 1.50 beta

   1. In order to get high reliability and compatibility with
      different file and operating systems, the RAR archive file
      format was changed (see TECHNOTE.DOC for details).

      RAR 1.50 is compatible with older releases and can handle
      archives created with previous versions, with the exception of
      minor functions - repair, create SFX and adding authenticity
      verification).

      Archives created with RAR 1.50 cannot be handled by older
      versions of RAR.

      Due to memory limitations, the functionality of backwards
      compatibility, will be reduced to a minimum.

   2. Compression speed has improved in the "most compressive" mode
      (when using the switch -m5).

   3. Password encryption algorithm improved. Files encrypted in
      archives with old RAR versions are also supported.

   4. Authenticity verification feature changed. When the archive is
      created with -av full integrity checking is performed.

   5. User interface improved.

   6. Pressing Control-Break causes return to RAR when used in full-
      screen mode, not exit to DOS as previously.

   7. String search implemented in internal viewer (F7).

   8. Edit function set extended for string enter.

   9. Option "After command ..." removed from Configuration.

   10. Option "Stdout mode" added to configuration.

   11. Switch -vs removed as the identical combination "-v -sfx"
       exists.

   12. Volume size can now be entered in kilobytes (not only in
       thousands of bytes). Add symbol 'k' for it.
