  This archive contains the RAR multifunctional integrated archive manager

                    The RAR Archiver - version 1.55

   RAR features:

 o RAR introduces a NEW and original compression algorithm.  It
   allows higher compression ratios than other PC archiving tools,
   especially on executable files, Object libraries, large text
   files, etc.

 o RAR offers NEW facilities and features such as a full-screen
   interactive interface utilising mouse and menus as well as the
   command line interface.

 o RAR provides functionality for creating a 'solid' archive, which
   can raise the compression ratio by 10% - 50% over more common
   methods, when packing large numbers of small files.

 o RAR gives the user, using the full-screen mode, the ability to
   manage non-RAR archives (.ZIP, .ARJ, .LZH).  The user may view
   update, transform to self-extracting (SFX) archive, add and
   erase comments, specify temporary work directory, etc.

 o RAR offers the ability to create and change SFX archives using
   default and external SFX modules, e.g. the installation SFX.

 o RAR offers the ability to create multi-volume archive as SFX.

 o RAR offers a number of service functions, such as setting a
   password, adding archive and file comments.  Damaged archives
   may be repaired and an archive may be locked to prevent further
   changes.  Authenticity information may be added for additional
   security and RAR will store information on the last update and
   name of the archive.

 o RAR provides ANSI esc-sequence support in comments.  This
   allows color comments and other ANSI features without the need
   for an ANSI-driver.
