Important announcement from the Worldwide RAR Support and Registration Team:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are pleased to announce that we can now offer a new service to all RAR
users (registered and un-registered), via the Internet.

The service revolves around an "automatic response" system, allowing you to
receive RAR information via an automated e-mail message service, triggered by
you writing to a particular internet address.

By simply sending a message to the relevant address, the information sheet
will be automatically sent to you. (The *text* of your message can be as short
and simple as "Info please" ... it is the ADDRESS that triggers the
information being sent)

Here are the current addresses available, and information on what you will
receive:
