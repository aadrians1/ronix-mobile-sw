<h2><a name="s1">1 Installing</a></h2>

<p>Installing PonyProg depend on the system you have.<br>
  With Windows95/98 or NT/2000 just run the Setup.exe and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>With Linux you need the V library v1.22 or newer correctly installed and the 
  GNU g++ compiler. If you want to use any parallel port interface you need also 
  a 2.2.x kernel and <i>parport</i>, <i>parport_pc</i> and <i>ppuser</i> kernel 
  modules.<br>
  Before to start install the V library, I assume you have the symbolic link from 
  your home directory to v library directory.<br>
  Login as root and follow these instructions:<br>
  Copy the file downloaded to a directory like /usr/local/src and decompress it 
  with &quot;tar xvfz ponyprog.tar.gz&quot;, then enter the directory ponyprog.<br>
  Make a link to the V configuration file, the Config.mk in the root directory 
  of the V library:<br>
  &quot;rm -f Config.mk; ln -s ~/v/Config.mk ./Config.mk&quot;<br>
  Then build the executable and install it with &quot;make linux; make installLinux&quot; 
  for a static linked executable or<br>
  &quot;make linuxelf; make installLinuxElf&quot; for a dinamic linked executable.<br>
  The executable will be installed in /usr/local/bin. You must run it in X-Window 
  environment. Before to run the executable insert the modules into the kernel 
  (insmod parport; insmod parport_pc; insmod ppuser).</p>
<p>The first time you run the program remember to select the interface and port 
  you use with the <a href="ponyprog.html#s2.5.1">Setup</a>. If the program report 
  a message like &quot;The interface don't respond&quot; when started, it means 
  that you not have configured the port properly, or the interface is not connected.<br>
  You need also to run <a href="ponyprog.html#s2.5.2">Calibration</a> in most 
  cases.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2">2 Menu commands</a></h2>

<p>The following is an explanation of each menu command. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.1">2.1 File</a></h2>

<h2><a name="s2.1.1">2.1.1 New</a></h2>

<p>Open a new window, each window can display the content of a device or file. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.1.2">2.1.2 Open</a></h2>

<p>Open a file by name, and read its content in the current window. You can select the
file to open through a dialog. PonyProg recognize four different types of file format:
e2p, intel hex, motorola S-record and raw binary. If the selected file don't seem to be a
e2p, it tries to open the file as intel hex; if also this operation fails, then it opens
the file as binary. If the file has e2p format, you don't have to worry about the device
type currently setted, otherwise you first have to <a href="ponyprog.html#s2.3.1">select</a>
the correct device type, then load a file. If you want to load a file for the Atmel AVR,
be sure to load the content of the flash first, and then the content of the eeprom. To do
so you have to configure the AVR assembler to generate Intel hex format with extension
.hex for the flash and .eep for the eeprom. The content of the eeprom will be displayed
after the content of the flash memory in the current window.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.1.3">2.1.3 Save</a></h2>

<p>Save the content of current window to a file. If no name has been specified work like <a href="ponyprog.html#s2.1.4">Save as</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.1.4">2.1.4 Save as</a></h2>

<p>Open a dialog box where you can specify the name of the file. In the bottom of the
dialog box you can select the file format for the file to save (indicated by the
extension). If you press OK the content of the current window will be saved in the file
specified. I suggest to save always in e2p format, doing so the device type and the notes
will be recorded in the file. The .bin format is raw binary format, it's suitable for
exporting the file to other programs.</p>

<p><img src="prog-saveas.jpg" alt="SaveAs screen shot" WIDTH="568" HEIGHT="408"></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.1.5">2.1.5 Print</a></h2>

<p>Open a dialog box where you can select the printer name and options. If you press OK
the content of the current buffer will be printed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.1.6">2.1.6 Close</a></h2>

<p>Close the current window, if there is only one opened window it ask if you want to
exit; you can choose Yes or No. If the current buffer is modified it ask you if you want
to save the content in a file before to close the window.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.1.7">2.1.7 Exit</a></h2>

<p>Close all the opened window and exit the program. If exist a modified buffer it ask you
if you want to save the content in a file before to close the window.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.2">2.2 Edit</a></h2>

<h2><a name="s2.2.1">2.2.1 Edit note</a></h2>

<p>Open a dialog box where you can edit a Chip id and a note. These two fields are saved
within the window content if you use the e2p file format (see <a href="ponyprog.html#s2.1.2">Open</a>). These two fields are free text editing, and are
useful for a description of the device programmed and the meaning of its content.</p>

<p><img src="prog-note.jpg" alt="Edit note screen shot" WIDTH="730" HEIGHT="157"></p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="s2.2.2">2.2.2 Security Bits</a></h2>
<p>Open a dialog box where you can edit a device specific Fuse and Security bits. 
  This dialog is especially useful for microcontrollers, because they could not 
  work at all without set these bits in the correct way. The following screen 
  dumps show the fuse bits of some microcontroller family. Note that disabled 
  bits (grayed) are not used or not modificable.</p>

<h2><a name="s2.2.3">2.2.3 Edit buffer enabled</a></h2>

<p>You can toggle this item either to enable or disable the edit mode. If this mode is
enabled you can edit the buffer content by clicking on a location of the current window.
Two editing modes are available: hexadecimal editing and text editing. If you click on the
HEX (center) part of the screen or press ENTER you open a dialog where you can insert the
new value for that byte in decimal, hexadecimal, or character. If you click on the ASCII
(right) part of the screen you open a dialog where you can insert or modify a text
starting from that location. You can CUT &amp; PASTE in the text entry dialog by the use
of the right mouse button. Note that you can enable/disable the edit mode of the current
window only, so if there are more than one buffer window opened, the edit mode of other
window remains unchanged.</p>

<p><img src="prog-edit.jpg" alt="Edit screen shot" WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="198"></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.3">2.3 Device</a></h2>

<h2><a name="s2.3.1">2.3.1 Select</a></h2>

<p>Select the type of current device. You have to select the device type before reading or
writing the device. Selecting an &quot;Auto XXX&quot;&nbsp; type means that the device
type is determined by the program during the read or write operation, this feature is
useful when you need to query a device to know if it works and which device it is. There
are some different device family: the I²C Bus eeproms that are addressed with 8 bit word,
the I²C Bus eeproms that are addressed with 16 bit word, the Microwire eeproms, the SPI
eeproms, the AVR microcontrollers and the PIC microcontrollers. You can select the device
family in the tool bar with the combo-box, or directly the device type in the menu. The
current device type is stored in the .INI file, so the next time you run the program it's
recalled. To read and write I²C Bus eeproms other than 24xx (i.e. the SDE2526, SDA2546,
SDA2586, SDA3546, SDA3586) select the type &quot;24XX Auto&quot;.<br>
The 24C01 can be readed but not writed, you can read it as a 2402 or 24XX Auto device.
Note that you can replace a 24C01 eeprom with a new 24C02 eeprom, because it's fully
compatible to the 24C01.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.3.2">2.3.2 Read</a></h2>

<p>Read the content of a device in the current window.&nbsp; This operation can take a
while to execute, so a dialog box shows that the operation is still in progress. If you
want to stop the current read just press the &quot;Abort&quot; button. Finally a dialog
box showing the result of the operation appears.<br>
If the program report the message &quot;The device not responding&quot; means that you
have missed to connect the device to read, or the interface is not configured properly
(see the <a href="ponyprog.html#s2.5.1">Setup</a>). Note that only the devices that
support probing report this type of message, other device simply read all 0's of FF's (if
the device is missed). The devices that support probing are the 24XX serie and the
&quot;AT90SXX Auto&quot;. In the specific case of&nbsp; &quot;AT90SXX Auto&quot; device
type selected, the program can report the message &quot;The device is locked&quot; in case
of the locked bits was programmed. Even some preproduction devices don't support auto
probing. You can't read a locked device, to program it see <a href="ponyprog.html#s2.3.3">Write</a>.<br>
<a name="sv15retry"></a>Since version 1.15c if you select an AVR device (AT90S2313 for
example) and read it, the program try to probe the device first. If the device is missing,
or the device is locked, or the device is a preproduction device a dialog box appears. It
asks if you want to abort operation, retry or ignore the error. In case of a preproduction
device just select &quot;Ignore&quot;.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.3.3">2.3.3 Write</a></h2>

<p>Write the content of the current window to a device. A dialog box ask you to confirm
this unrecoverable operation. This operation can take a while to execute, so a dialog box
shows that the operation is still in progress. If you want to stop the current write just
press the &quot;Abort&quot; button. After the writing an automatic verify is executed.
Finally a dialog box showing the result of the operation appears.<br>
Before to do a write I suggest to select the specific device type, not the &quot;24XX
Auto&quot; or &quot;AT90SXX Auto&quot;. Note that if you select a &quot;AT90SXX Auto&quot;
device and try to write a locked device you get the message: &quot;The device is
locked&quot;.<br>
Note that both the flash and eeprom are writed (only if the device have both flash and
eeprom like the AVR), and then verified.<br>
Since the version 1.15c a probe is performed on every AVR device (see <a href="#sv15retry">Read</a>).</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.3.4">2.3.4 Verify</a></h2>

<p>Verify the content of a device, compares it to the content of&nbsp; the current
window.&nbsp; This operation can take a while to execute, so a dialog box shows that the
operation is still in progress. If you want to stop the current verify just press the
&quot;Abort&quot; button. Finally a dialog box showing the result of the operation
appears.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.3.5">2.3.5 GetInfo</a></h2>

<p>Shows some informations about the device. Some of these informations are showed also in
the status bar at the bottom of the main window. 

<ul>
  <li>Size of the buffer, it's equal to the size of the device in bytes. In the case of AVR
    devices, it's equal to the sum of the flash size plus the eeprom size.</li>
  <li>CRC calculated on the content of the buffer.</li>
  <li>Bank roll over. It's a characteristic of some old I²C Bus eeprom. You can't simply
    replace a &quot;roll-over eeprom&quot; with a &quot;no roll-over eeprom&quot;.</li>
  <li>Security and High endurance block. The 24C65, have a feature to protect some block from

<h2><a name="s2.4">2.4 Utility</a></h2>

<h2><a name="s2.4.1">2.4.1 Double bank</a></h2>

<p>This operation duplicates every bank in the current buffer and changes the 
  device type to a bigger device type. A bank is a cluster of 256 bytes for the 
  24xx and a word for other devices. This utility is useful to replace a SDA2546 
  device with a 24C08 or a SDA2586 with a 24C16. To do it you have to select the 
  device type &quot;24xx Auto&quot;, connect the SDA2546 device and perform a 
  <a href="ponyprog.html#s2.3.2">Read</a> operation. Then you have to perform 
  a &quot;Double bank&quot;, replace the SDA2546 with a blank 24C08 and perform 
  a <a href="ponyprog.html#s2.3.3">Write</a> operation.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.4.2">2.4.2 Byte swap</a></h2>

<p>This operation swap bytes within every word in the buffer. This command is useful to
convert from little endian representation to big endiand and viceversa. Some devices uses
16bit word so you can represent it in both ways depending on your needs.<br>
For example consider the number 1234 hex (4660 decimal), the little endian is 34 - 12,
while the big endiand is 12 - 34.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.4.3">2.4.3 Write security</a></h2>

<p>This command is implemented only for some devices.<br>
With the AVR you can lock the program and eeprom memory from further reading by using this
command. When the device is locked you can rewrite it, but not read it. Note that if you
try to read a locked device with the type &quot;AT90Sxx Auto&quot; setted you receive the
message &quot;The device is locked&quot;; you have to select the specific device before to
write to it.<br>
With the 24C65 a dialog ask to insert the first block and the number of blocks to lock.
When the device is locked you can't do a &quot;write security&quot; or a &quot;write high
endurance&quot; anymore. To lock the device the number of blocks must be greater than 0.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.4.4">2.4.4 Write high endurance</a></h2>

<p>This command is implemented only for the 24C65 eeprom. A dialog ask you to insert the
high endurance block (support more write operations). When the device is locked this
command don't work.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.4.5">2.4.5 Clear Buffer</a></h2>

<p>Clear the current buffer with FF's.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.4.6">2.4.6 Fill Buffer</a></h2>

<p>Fill the current buffer with a character. Open a dialog where you can select the
addresses fo fill (from - to locations), and the value of the character to fill. You can
insert the value either in decimal (i.e. 45), hexadecimal (i.e. 0x45) or octal (i.e. 045)
base.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s2.5">2.5 Options</a></h2>

<h2><a name="s2.5.1">2.5.1 Setup</a></h2>

<p>Open a dialog box where you can select the interface type and the port number where the
hardware is connected. You can choose from several hardware interfaces (see <a href="../prog.html#hardware">PonyProg Hardware interfaces</a> for more info). Note that
only SI Prog support all the devices.</p>

<p><img src="prog-setup.jpg" alt="Setup screen shot" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="352"> 

<ul>
  <li><strong>SI-Prog interface</strong> select &quot;serial&quot; check-box and 
    choose &quot;SI-Prog API&quot; or&nbsp; &quot;SI-Prog I/O&quot; in the combo-box. 
    Windows 95, 98, 2000 and NT work either with &quot;PonyProg API&quot; and 
    &quot;PonyProg I/O&quot;, but the latter is faster. To use the &quot;SI-Prog 
    I/O&quot; with Linux you need to run PonyProg as root. Then select the COM 
    port you want to use, if some COM ports are disabled it means that they are 
    used by other programs (usually by the mouse driver or modem), or not present.</li>
  <li><strong>AVR ISP Parallel port interface</strong> select &quot;parallel&quot; 
    check-box and choose &quot;Avr ISP API&quot; or &quot;Avr ISP I/O&quot; in 
    the combo-box. WindowsNT/2000 work only with &quot;Avr ISP I/O&quot;. To use 
    the &quot;Avr ISP I/O&quot; with Linux you need to run PonyProg as root. Then 
    select the LPT port you want to use. Note that if you want to program the 
    AT89Sxx device you need to select the &quot;Invert Reset&quot; check-box. 
    To use this interface with Linux you need a 2.2.x kernel and parport, parport_pc 
    and ppuser kernel modules.<br>
    You can use this interface to read/write the AVR micros and SPI eeproms..</li>
  <li><strong>Ludipipo interface</strong> select &quot;serial&quot; check-box 
    and choose &quot;SI-Prog API&quot; or &quot;SI-Prog I/O&quot;. Then select 
    the COM port you use and select the &quot;Invert D-OUT&quot; check-box. You 
    can use this interface to read/write the PIC16x84.</li>
  <li><strong>Easy I²CBus interface</strong> select the &quot;parallel&quot; check-box, 
    then select the LPT port you want to use. With Linux you need to run PonyProg 
    as root because EasyI2CBus interface use the I/O driver.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="s2.5.2">2.5.2 Calibration</a></h2>

<p>Calibration tunes the serial bus speed for your computer. When you run Calibration 
  be sure that PonyProg is the only program running in the PC, and the hard disk 
  is idle (look at the HD led). If your PC is busy because it's performing other 
  tasks the Calibration thinks your PC is slower than actual speed, and all I/Os 
  are performed without proper delay.<br>
After the Calibration you can choose the speed for every serial bus modifying the
following parameters in the ponyprog.ini (.PonyProgrc under Linux) file: 

<ul>
  <li><strong>I2CBusSpeed</strong>=<em>NORMAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>affect 24Cxx eeprom and
    other I²CBus devices</li>
  <li><strong>SPIBusSpeed</strong>=<em>NORMAL</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affect AVR micro, AT89Sxx
    micro and 25xxx eeprom</li>
  <li><strong>MicroWireBusSpeed</strong>=<em>NORMAL</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affect 93Cxx eeprom</li>
  <li><strong>PICBusSpeed</strong>=<em>NORMAL</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affect PIC16x84 micro</li>
  <li><strong>SDEBusSpeed</strong>=<em>NORMAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>affect SDE2506 eeprom</li>
</ul>

<p>Every parameter can be assigned the value <em>SLOW</em>, <em>NORMAL</em>, <em>FAST</em> 
  or <em>TURBO.<br>
  </em>Avoid to use the TURBO value because it means &quot;no delay&quot;, and 
  probably it doesn't work on your PC, especially with the I/O driver.<br>
  Just for example my PC (Pentium MMX 200MHz) run I²CBus at about 80Khz with <em>NORMAL,</em> 
  and 110 Khz with <em>FAST.</em> Note that a lot of I²CBus devices don't work 
  at speed above the 100KHz.</p>
