0. What you need.
-----------------
You need a RoEmmi box and a version of Emaster to work with it.
It is recommanded to use a Pentium II 300 Mhz PC with emasterh.exe.
For a slow computer is recommanded emaster.exe.

1. Installing RoEmmi.
---------------------
Connect to the box the power supply. 
Connect to the box the cable you need for the phone type you want to operate.
Connect a LPT extension cable to your computer printer connector (LPT).
Start Emaster.
WARNING: be shure your LPT port is free and it is assigned to I/O address 0x378.
It must be configured as an EPP port. 


2. Using Emaster.
-----------------
From Windows start Emaster. If the programm ask for a password type it.
If the box is right conected to your PC you must see:

RoEmmi Controler v1.0.
r - read lock from slave phone
u - unlock slave phone
l - lock slave phone
f - flash slave phone
i - imei change on slave phone
q - quit EMaster

Emmi Host connected
Phone disconected
Wait connection to emmi host
Emmi Host connected
Wait connection to slave phone

At the point you can operate mot phones.

WARNING: At this moment commands i and f are desactivated. Ask for upgrades


3. Connecting phone.
--------------------

With the box installed and the programm started on the PC plug the cable from box to the phone. If the phone 
does not turn on push the phone power button. The phone must turn on in about 1 sec and you will see on the PC screen:

Phone connected
MASTER?>

Now you can operate phone.
WARNING: for the best results is recommanded you connect the phone without a simcard
and operate with the phone turned on.


4. Unlocking phone.
-------------------
With the phone connected to box/PC type 'u'.
You will see:

MASTER?>u
Send unlock request to phone
MASTER?>

5. Locking phone.
-----------------
With the phone connected to box/PC type 'r' and after that 'l'.
You will see:

MASTER?>r
Lock Value stored in RAM
MASTER?>l
Send lock request to phone
MASTER?>

6. Disconnecting phone.
-----------------------
Plug off the phone from the cable. You will see:

MASTER?>Wait connection to emmi host
Emmi Host connected
Wait connection to slave phone

That means the box is ready for other connection.

7. Troubles
-----------
A very few number of phones 'refuse' to be directly unlocked. Thats becouse a new mot security schema.
At this moment they can be done by relocking first the phone ('r' and 'l') and after that unlocking or
by ('r' and 'u').
