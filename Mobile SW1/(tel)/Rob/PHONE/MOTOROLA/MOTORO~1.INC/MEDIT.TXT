-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Version 3.03 of my "MotEditor" now with full bitmap-support
AND editable phonebook!

It's pure ANSI C and should be compileable with almost all C-Compilers.

Thanks to Janus, because he's doing it!
Thanks to ANDROID for his wonderfull work with ASIM!

First of all: You can probably DAMAGE YOUR PHONE with this program! But that
is in your hands, so don't blame me if something happens. Don't say I didn't
warn you!
I have tested it ONLY on a M8700 at the moment (although people around the
world are using it), so be careful on other phones.

This package consists of:
-------------------------
	-) MEDIT.C	Source
	-) MEDIT.EXE	Executable for DOS
	-) MEDIT.MNU	Menudefinitions file
	-) ENGF_ON.MNU	Import this to frame 1 to get "Eng Field Options"
	-) EXAMPLE.BMP	Example wake-up graphic
	-) PB_EXAMP.TXT	Example phonebook file
	-) MEDIT.TXT	This file

What does this program?
-----------------------
MEDIT is only useful, if you have:
	-) a Motorola GSM phone, e.g. 7x00, 8x00, StarTac, SlimLite,...
	-) the SIM CARD EMULATOR hardware as introduced by Android
	-) ASIM, the program for the SIM CARD EMULATOR by Android
	-) enough nerves to do it.

With MEDIT you can:
	-) enable/disable ALL menus on your phone, even hidden ones.
	-) put your own startup-graphic in the phone/export the existing one.
	-) export and import the phonebook in a textfile.

How to use
----------
* First, download all frames (1 to 5) from your phone with ASIM and keep them
* safe somewhere (as a backup...).
* Then ALWAYS download your frames before you start MEDITing them, because
* you probably have changed some phone settings inbetween.

MEDIT is (at this time) only a command-line program. Usage is always the same:
Start MEDIT with a binary framefile as argument and infos are printed,
depending on the frame number.
Or you start MEDIT with framefile and a textfile as arguments and framefile is
changed. If you give a filename as last argument, the changed data is written
there instead. Same with bitmap.

	MEDIT [-v] framefile [textfile [outframe]]
or
	MEDIT [-v] framefile -br bitmap [outframe]

where framefile is a binary frame saved in ASIM, either number 1, 2, 3 or 4.
Depending on the number of the frame, textfile has to be either a
menu-definitions file (for frame 1 or 4) or a phonebook file (for frame 2 and 3).

Outframe is the binary file where the result is written. If omitted, framefile
IS OVERWRITTEN!

Export of the greeting-bitmap is a bit different:

	MEDIT [-v] framefile -bw bitmap

The file "framefile" is not changed, but the file "bitmap" is created/overwritten
with the existing startup-bitmap of framefile.

Option "-v" always displays verbose messages of what MEDIT is doing.


Enabling/disabling Menus
------------------------
Download frame 1 with ASIM and try
	MEDIT frame1.bin > mymenu.txt
then edit mymenu.txt, you'll see which menus are enabled. Set the appropriate
zeros to 1 if you want to enable a menu. Then store the info back to your
frame:
	MEDIT frame1.bin mymenu.txt
and reload frame1.bin to your phone. That's it!
The same information is stored in frame #4, but I have not tried on #4,
just #1!

Descriptions of menus are kept in medit.mnu, the format of this file is just
like the exported. You can make additional description-entries there. Be sure
that medit.mnu is in the same dir as medit.exe or no descriptions will be
available in output.
File format is simple, have a look at medit.mnu for example. You can safely
delete lines (-> no change), and only 0 and 1 are valid characters for
switching off/on menus, all other are ignored (->don't cares)


Exporting greeting-bitmap
-------------------------
Use MEDIT like this
	MEDIT frame1.bin -bw bitmap.bmp
to get the existing greeting-bitmap as Windows-bitmap. It can be edited with
almost any bitmap editor and then stored back to your phone.
MEDIT tries to export the bitmap even if your phone hasn't a graphical display,
so you might get only scrambled bits.


Changing greeting-bitmap
------------------------
* Keep a backup of your orginial frame 1, I haven't tried yet if the original
* bitmap can be restored with a "master reset"!

Make a Windows-bitmap, width=96 and height=32 in 1-bit color (monochrome).
With
	MEDIT frame1.bin bitmap.bmp outframe.bin
the startup graphics in frame1 is replaced by your bitmap and written in
outframe.bin. Reload outframe.bin to phone, and that's it!


Import/export of phonebook
--------------------------
Start MEDIT like this: (to export your phonebook to a text file):
	MEDIT frame2.bin > names.txt
	MEDIT frame3.bin >> names.txt
Afterwards have a look at names.txt
The format of each line in that file is always
	NUM NUMBER TEXT
where NUM=location(1-100), NUMBER=telephone number (including of "+*#p" is
possible; max. 32 chars, "+" not included) and TEXT=name of entry (max
16 chars). If a line consists only of NUM, the corresponding phonebook entry
is deleted. Non existing entry numbers are not changed.
Edit the file or create a new one in the same format and import it again to
your frames with
	MEDIT frame2.bin names.txt
	MEDIT frame3.bin names.txt
(Frame2 holds numbers from 1 to 74 and frame3 from 75 to 100.)
Don't forget to reload it to your phone!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

AGAIN:
DISCAIMER: I WILL NOT claim ANY responsibility if you damage your phone with this
program! Be carefull!

Please send bug-reports, enhancements, "yes it works with my type-XXXX phone",
new menu descriptions, nice startup-bitmaps or greetings to tst@iname.com
