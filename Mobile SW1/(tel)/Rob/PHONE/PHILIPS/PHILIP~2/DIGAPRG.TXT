Diga.exe works with SPRG hardware.
Don't need of external power suply.
Vcc is about 3v (Don't damage phone).
Don't need to desolder EEPROM chip.

*************************************************************************
* THIS IS BETA VERSION , TEST IT ON CHIP's , NOT ON WORKING PHONES !!!! *
*             If O.K. use it with phone on OWN RISK !                   *

Backup   - Not implemented.
All      - Read all chip to data buffer.                 (NO VERIFICATION !)
Read     - Read current chip page (256 bytes) to buffer. (NO VERIFICATION !)
Program  - Writes current page (256 bytes) to chip.      (NO VERIFICATION !)
Verify   - Verify current page with chip. (Not matched bytes - displayed in RED)
Lockswap - Swaps SIMLOCK info and recalculates checksum.(Changed bytes in GREEN)

I test this on phones with firmware versions : 08002400 , 08001200.
Under Win3.11 and DOS6.22

NCK are valid only for Firmware 08001510.

Procedure of SIM-Unlocking :

* A - read all memory.
* S - save it to file.
* Home - back to 0 page.
* V - verify info.
  L - modify info.
  P - write to EEPROM.
  V - verify.
  Turn on phone and test.(Don't need to disconnect phone from programmer).

* You can read only 0 page , don't save info ,  but who knows ...

If repeat this for unlocked phone - Phone will be Locked again.

With this hardware and software You can read,program,edit all
I2C EEPROMS from 24c01 to 24c16.

If don't work under Windows , specify other LPT port or
disconnect printer in Control Panel or run in DOS session.

This program will not work under Windows NT !
