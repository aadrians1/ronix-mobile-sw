  WHAT IS LOGOMANAGER?
  --------------------

  LogoManager allows you to customise your Nokia phone.  It was designed for
  use with the 6100 series phones (6110, 6130, 6150, nk702), but may 
  also operate with other models.

  You can change the startup graphic, operator logos and group graphics with
  the aid of a datasuite cable.  To find out where you can get a suitable cable,
  please see the web site:

      http://www.logomanager.co.uk/


  Features:

      - No need to send SMS messages
      - MBUS compatible cables are NOT required
      - Nokia Data Suite is NOT needed
      - Fully-featured set of editing tools
      - 3-in-1 solution for only $19.95


  BEFORE YOU INSTALL
  ------------------

  This software is supplied 'as is' and the author takes no responsibility 
  for any damage incurred due to it's installation.  It has, however, been
  extensively tested and is unlikely to cause problems on any Windows 95/98/NT
  machine.

  Note that in the unregistered version, logos may have the word 'demo' 
  overlayed onto them.

  IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ THE LICENCE AGREEMENT


  INSTALLATION/SETUP
  ------------------

  Extract the files into a directory using an unzip utility

  Connect your phone to the COM port via the cable

  If you have previously used the Nokia Data Suite, you should be ready to go, 
  otherwise you may need to select the appropriate COM port in the properties
  dialog (tools menu).

  To complete the installation, run the program.

  
  RUNNING LOGOMANAGER
