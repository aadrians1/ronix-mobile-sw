This proggy is very simpe in use, just enter IMEI number and press
ENTER. You will get the code. To remove simlock, power on the phone
and type: *#7465625*12*12345678#, 7465625 means SIMLOCK :) and 
12345678 is number that you have generated.
Thats all.

Tested with ERAGSM only:<
Please let me know if you have succesufully remove simlock 
using my prog.


Next version soon.
