24Cxx PIC 16C84 Combiprogrammer for the Henk Schaer,David Tait and
LudiPipo interface
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

interface connections
----------------------
you can use the HS or DT printerport interface without any modifycations.
the only thing you have to do is to connect a 8 pin DIL socket.
you have to make the following connections:

for the 24CXX:

1 ,2 ,3 ,4 and 7 to ground.
5 to 16C84 pin 13(RB7), 6 to 16C84 pin 12(RB6) and 8 to 16C84 14(VDD)

for the 12C508:

508 pin 7 =GP0 -> Clock input 16C84 RB6
508 pin 6 =GP1 -> Data  input/output 16C84 RB7
508 pin 4 =GP3 -> Vpp 16C84 Vpp
508 pin 1 =VDD -> Power 
508 pin 8 =Vss -> ground

it's easiest to use the 16C84 socket pin 1..4 and 15..18.Vpp is already connected
that way.

Remember Vpp must be able to deliver enough current (up to 30 mA) and keep 12 Volt.

 


Use

command line arguments:
H2:Henk Schaer lpt2
D61/D62:David Tait lpt1/lpt2
D1/D2:David Tait 07 lpt1/lpt2
L1..L4:LudiPipo COM1..COM4

most of the program should be obvious (I hope).
HEX files can only be of the Intel HEX8M type.To load a HEX file first
select the device type ,then load the file.
HEX files must have the *.hex extension,binairy files must have the
*.bin extension.These files should be in the same directory as the
programmer.
the buffer can be saved as a binairy or HEX file,the *.bin or *.hex
extension is added automatically.

LudiPipo
--------
support for the LudiPipo interface has been added since version 0.7.
this interface is very simple and works without an external power
supply.so it's easy and cheap to build.
but this system won't work on all machines:in some cases the
programming voltage becomes too low.
it's a pity we don't hear much from 'Der Ludi' any more!

16F84
-----
the 16F84 is almost exactly the same as the 16c84 but the Code protect
is much improved and the PowerupTimer bit is inverted.When reading a
16C84 HEX file this bit will have to be set.

error messages
--------------
'error' during reading or programming:wrong device,device not properly
connected,program interface not connected,power supply not connected,
HEX file with illegal data(16C84).
'reload HEX file':HEX file loaded in wrong mode,first
select the device type ,then load the file.
