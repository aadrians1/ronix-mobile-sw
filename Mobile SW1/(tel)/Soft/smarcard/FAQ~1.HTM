<H2>1. Purpose of 
alt.technology.smartcards.</H2>
The purpose of a.t.s is to provide an unmoderated forum for the discussion of technology, applications 
and issues associated with smart cards (the decentralization of computing power and information storage 
to the level of the individual). It will serve as a source for people to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Engage in discussion and debate about technical and public policy issues including the security, 
privacy, legal, regulatory and economic impact of smart card applications.
<LI>Educate and inform others about the strength, weaknesses and general use of SmartCards; share 
ideas, information and specific experience about SmartCards, both in technology:
<UL>
<LI>standardization
<LI>security
<LI>design
<LI>programming
<LI>manufacturing
</UL>
<LI>,and use in various businesses:
<UL>
<LI>present use
<LI>prospectives for the future
<LI>economic issues
<LI>organizational issues
<LI>psychological problems
<LI>social issues
</UL>
<LI>Find information and have questions answered.  The newsgroup is not itself a depository of 
information, but rather will attempt to direct people to bits (on-line resources) and atoms (books, 
periodicals, proceedings) related to smart card topics.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>2. General Questions</H2>
<H3>2.1. What is a smart card?</H3>
The word “smart card” is used in three different meanings (in order of usage frequency):<P>
<OL>
<LI>IC card with ISO 7816 interface
<LI>Processor IC card
<LI>Personal identity token containing IC-s
</OL>
 Integrated Circuit(s) Card is ad ID-1 type (specified in ISO 7810) card, into which has been inserted one 
or more integrated circuits. [ISO 7816]<P>
IC cards can be devised by the capabilities of the chip:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Memory cards, which can just store data and have no data processing capabilities.
<LI>Wired Logic aka Intelligent Memory cards, which contain also some built-in logic, usually used to 
control the access to the memory of the card.
<LI>Processor cards, which contain memory and processor and have thus remarkable data processing 
capabilities. Very often the data processing power is used to encrypt/decrypt data, which makes this type 
of card very unique person identification token. Data processing permits also the dynamic storage 
management, which enables realization of flexible multifunctional card.
</UL>
As the manufacturing process and most apparent functionality to ordinary user of all ISO IC cards are 
similar, the “smart card” denotes usually ISO IC card. When the security is the most important, memory 
card equals to magnetic stripe card and “smart” can be called only an encrypting device. As the number of 
system designers is small relative to ordinary users, the second meaning is suppressed by the first 
one.<P>
Although the PC card’s size is also ID-1 and it contain integrated circuits, they are usually not called 
smart cards, because they are rarely personal. When PC card implements Personal Security Environment, 
it fits to third meaning of smart card and can be called as such.<P>
NB! When it is important not to confuse different meanings, try to define briefly YOUR understanding of 
“smart card”.<P>
<H3>2.2. Where did the word smart card come 
from?</H3>
The French of course.  While inventors in the U.S., Japan and Austria, were issued patents that pre-date 
those of Frenchman Roland Moreno, it was the French who put up big money to push the technology.  
They did this in the 1970's, during a period of major national investment in modernizing the nation's 
technology infrastructure.  The first company to make major R&amp D investments in the technology was 
Bull which holds about 60 patents related to MP cards.  Cards were original none as "Carte a memoire" or 
memory card.  In 1980, when France began a major campaign to export the technology, the Roy Bright of 
the government's marketing organization Intelimatique coined the word "Smart Card."<P>
<H3>2.3. What are the leading applications/projects to 
date?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Carte Bancaire in France, 22 millions of cards delivered. Chip is used to authenticate the card 
dynamically.
<LI>Telecarte in France, the first large-scale stored vale chipcard application. Chip contains just the 
memory.
<LI>Health insurance card in Germany, memory card is issued to every German citizen.
</UL>
The number of different smartcard based payment system pilots is estimated to 40 (ESCAT’94)<P>
A sensible description of application areas and valuable characteristics of smartcards in these areas is 
needed here. Anybody willing to write it?<P>
<H3>2.4. What is PCMCIA or PC Card?</H3>
PCMCIA stands for Personal Computer Memory Card Industry Association, which in March 1995 
changed its name to PC Card Industry Association to reflect the wide range of peripheral devices 
(modems, software, games) which can be used in these slots on computers.  PCMCIA was formed by 200 
companies in the late 1980s to set standards for cards used in laptops, notebooks, palm computers etc.  
They established Type I, II &amp  III standards.  The cards are thinker than credit cards and are rigid.  The 
have a very high band width compared to ISO smart cards.  People in the smart card industry like to refer 
to PC Cards and machine card and smart cards as people cards.<P>
<H3>2.5. Why my friend can not access a.t.s?</H3>
Note that alt.technology.smartcards is a part of “alt” hierarchy and ‘"alt" is a collection of newsgroups that 
is being distributed by a collection of sites that choose to carry the groups.  Many Usenet sites do not 
receive these groups.’ Apparently the news server of your friend decided to not carry a.t.s.<P>
He can try to change news server or ask his newsmaster to take a.t.s onto the news server. Newsmaster is 
usually reached under name newsmaster@&lt news server name&gt  or news@&lt news server name&gt , 
where &lt news server name&gt  is replaced by the actual name of your friend’s news server. To find a 
feed, some machines that carry a.t.s can be discovered in ‘path:’ section of header of article posted in 
a.t.s.<P>
<H3>2.6. Is a.t.s archived somewhere?</H3>
As far as we know, it is not. There have been plans to start archiving it on www.ioc.ee, but the question is 
open yet. There are two contradicting arguments:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Archiving rises the quality of group. Everybody posting in a.t.s have to remember that his posting can 
be easily reviewed. Archiving helps to avoid repeating questions.
<LI>Archiving might discourage novices from posting articles and deprive a.t.s from many fresh 
viewpoints.
</UL>
Anybody feeling need to say anything pro or contra archiving, can express his considerations in a.t.s as 
well as mail to <A HREF = "mailto:jean@ioc.ee">Jaan Priisalu</A> .<P>
<H3>2.7. Can we discuss smartcard hacking too?</H3>
Yes! The publication of security systems’ cracking methods is not immoral, it is immoral to use them 
against property of other people. Discussions about weaknesses and strengths of smartcards systems are 
welcome. The consequences of smartcard systems security proprieties are good discussion topics in 
a.t.s.<P>
Hacking surely is one part of security, there are people doing it legally and illegally, as job and as hobby. 
It should be fruitful to learn the “opponents” for both sides. It is good also to understand the motivation 
behind different behaviors.<P>
Some topics are defined illegal in some countries, if you happen to live in or to be a citizen of such a 
country, watch your words. Its just one part of relation between you and your government, it does not 
concern the World in general.<P>
<H3>2.8. Is there any “black book”?</H3>
Not for smartcards in general. For satellite TV cards, there is a lot of information; look into arbitrary 
newsgroups.<P>
<H3>2.9. Is a.t.s the right place for collection lists?</H3>
Definitely not. Look into rec.collecting hierarchy.<P>
<HR>
<H2>3. <A NAME = sorc></A>Standardization 
of smartcards</H2>
<H3>3.1. Are smartcards standardized</H3>
Yes and no. There are several common interest aspects of smartcard standards, but application specific 
proprieties are just under standardization. There are also several aspects, where just local standardization 
is needed, for example the memory map for stored value phonecards.<P>
We list here the international organizations active in smartcard standardization (the list is not exhaustive; 
current status of standards is not expressed):<P>
ISO/IEC JTC1 Information technology <A HREF = "http://www.iso.ch/meme/JTC1SC17.html">SC 17 
Identification cards and related devices</A> is interested in common smartcard issues. The list of some 
standards:<P>
<UL>
<LI>ISO 7810 Identification cards -- Physical characteristics. Specifies ID-1 format 
(85.60*53.98*0.76mm)
<LI>ISO/IEC 7812 Identification cards -- Identification of issuers.
<LI>ISO/IEC 7816 Identification cards -- Integrated circuit(s) with contacts. Parts 1-3 define the 
communication of cards with contacts for both memory and processor cards. Parts 4-6 are related to 
specification of processor card operating system and are by their nature contact independent. Parts 7 and 
8 will be the extensions of parts 4 and 6.
<LI>ISO/IEC 10536 Identification cards -- Contactless integrated circuit(s) cards. The standard specifies 
close coupling (slot and surface) cards communication (parts 1-3)
<LI>ISO/IEC 10373 Identification cards -- Test methods.
<LI>ISO/IEC 14443 Remote coupling communication cards.
</UL>
ISO TC 68 Banking and related financial services <A HREF = 
"http://www.iso.ch/meme/TC68SC6.html">SC 6 Financial transaction cards, related media and 
operations</A>  is representing interest of smart payment card issuers and is developing the standard 
series ISO 10202 Financial transaction cards -- Security architecture of financial transaction systems 
using integrated circuit cards (parts 1-8).<P>
CEN/CENELEC and ETSI are interested in telecommunications. <P>
<UL>
<LI>EN 742 Identification cards: location of contacts for cards and devices used in Europe. New edition 
specifies the format ID-000 used for GSM Subscriber Identity Module (SIM).
<LI>EN 726 Terminal Equipment (TE); Requirements for IC cards and terminals for telecommunication 
use. The standard is the technical basis for smartcards in Europe.
<LI>ETSI specified also the GSM SIM. The standard have two names: GSM 11.11 and I-ETSI 300045.
</UL>
CEN/CENELEC is also working on:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Electronic purse file specification. Special and very important application file type in card mask. 
There have to be resolved very hard integrity and security problems.
<LI>Health care card. The aim is to develop the standard of European medical card, which enables easy 
identification of patient and fast query of his medical data, rising thus effectiveness of medical care.
</UL>
Europay, MasterCard and Visa formed working group to create their “Integrated Circuit Card 
Specifications for Payment Systems”. The specification was intended to create common technical basis 
to compete with Mondex specifications. The first version was based on cards with symmetric encryption 
and the key transportation was unresolved. Current status of the standard is unknown.<P>
RSA is the leading company in public key cryptosystems development. Their PKCS#11 is functional 
specification of personal cryptographic token, used in computer security (also data security) 
systems.<P>
<A HREF = "http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</A>  <A 
HREF = "http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/fips/fip140^~1.txt">FIPS 140-1</A> , "Security Requirements for 
Cryptographic Modules"  concerns physical security of smartcard IC-s as they are one kind of 
cryptographic modules.<P>
<H3>3.2. Where do I get the ISO standards and the 
Europay/MasterCard/Visa specification?</H3>
ISO standards are delivered via <A HREF = "http://www.iso.ch/isob/direct/member/e">your national ISO 
member</A>  body.<P>
Integrated Circuit Card Specifications for Payment Systems can be obtained from a Visa, MasterCard or 
Europay member bank. Note that the Part 1 release 1.0 May 23, 1994 bears the notice about the 
confidentiality of the document. The notice is not repeated on other issues.<P>
<H3>3.3. What contains ISO 7816?</H3>
ISO 7816 Integrated Circuit Cards with Electrical Contacts<P>
The International Standards Organization (ISO) facilitates the creation of voluntary standards through a 
consensus-building process that is open to interested participants. ISO 7816 is the international standard 
for integrated-circuit cards (commonly known as smart cards) that use electrical contacts. Anyone 
interested in obtaining a technical understanding of smart cards needs to become familiar with what ISO 
7816 does NOT cover as well as what it does.<P>
ISO 7816 does not address smart card applications. Most current and planned applications require custom 
files and coding. However, there are efforts under way to create common application standards. The most 
prominent current example is the cooperative development of financial payments standards by Europay 
International, MasterCard International and Visa International (EMV).<P>
ISO 7816 has six parts. Some have been completed; others are currently in draft stage.<P>
<H4>3.3.1. Part 1: Physical characteristics</H4>
ISO 7816-1:1987 defines the physical dimensions of contact smart cards and their resistance to static 
electricity, electromagnetic radiation and mechanical stress. It also prescribe the physical location of a IC 
card's magnetic stripe and embossing area. <P>
<H4>3.3.2. Part 2: Dimensions and Location of Contacts</H4>
ISO 7816-2:1988 Defines the location, purpose and electrical characteristics of the card's metallic 
contacts:<P>
C1: VCC (Supply voltage)<P>
C2: RST (Reset)<P>
C3: CLK (Clock signal)<P>
C5: GND (Ground)<P>
C6: VPP (Programming voltage)<P>
C7: I/O (Data input/output)<P>
Contacts C4 and C8 have no function and need not be physically present on the card<P>
<H4>3.3.3. Part 3: Electronic Signals and Transmission 
Protocols</H4>
ISO 7816-3:1989 defines the voltage and current requirements for the electrical contacts defined in Part 
2 and asynchronous half-duplex character transmission protocol (T=0). <P>
Smart cards that use a proprietary transmission protocol carry the designation, T=14. In practical terms, 
that means the card is not compatible with ISO 7816. Proprietary protocol is used in German health care 
cards.<P>
Amendment 1:1992 Protocol type T=1, asynchronous half duplex block transmission protocol. <P>
Amendment 2:1994 Revision of protocol type selection<P>
<H4>3.3.4. Part 4: Inter-industry Commands for 
Interchange</H4>
ISO 7816-4 is a Draft International Standard that will establish a set of commands across all industries to 
provide access, security and transmission of card data. Within this basic kernel, for example, are 
commands to read, write and update records. <P>
<H4>3.3.5. Part 5: Numbering System and Registration 
Procedure for Application Identifiers</H4>
ISO 7816-5:1994 establishes standards for Application Identifiers (AIDs). An AID has two parts. The first 
is a Registered Application Provider Identifier (RID) of five bytes that is unique to the vendor. The second 
part is a variable length field of up to 11 bytes that RIDs can use to identify specific applications.  <P>
<H4>3.3.6. Part 6: Inter-industry data elements</H4>
ISO 7816-6 is in DIS stage. It describes encoding rules for data needed in many applications e.g. name and 
photograph of owner, his preference of languages etc.<P>
<H3>3.4. What contains Smart Card Payment 
Specifications?</H3>
Europay International, MasterCard International and Visa International (EMV) are cooperatively 
developing specifications to facilitate the use of smart cards for payments worldwide. These 
specifications build upon the ISO 7816 standards that have been developed for smart cards which use 
electrical contacts.<P>
The EMV specifications, now currently in draft and subject to revision and refinement, are grouped into 
three parts:<P>
Part I: Electromechanical Characteristics, Logical Interface, and Transmission Protocols<P>
Part II: Data Elements and Commands<P>
Part III: Transaction Processing<P>
<H4>3.4.1. Part I: Electromechanical Characteristics, Logical 
Interface, and Transmission Protocols</H4>
This part of the specifications concentrates on physical and logical elements of the interaction between 
smart cards and electronic terminals used for payment transactions.<P>
Building on the ISO 7816 standards, this part describes the physical dimensions of the card, the location 
of mandatory and optional electrical contacts and the electrical characteristics of such basic card 
operations as input/output, clock signal, reset, supply voltage and electrical contact resistance.<P>
Also in this part are descriptions of a terminal's mechanical and electrical characteristics. These parallel 
the subsection on card characteristics.<P>
All elements of a transaction session between a card and a terminal's interface device (IFD) are described. 
A transaction session begins when a card first enters an IFD and activates the electrical contacts of both. 
The card provides an answer to the IFD's reset signal, which establishes communication between the two. 
Following a transaction between the card and IFD, the IFD sends a reset signal that leads to the 
deactivation of both card and terminal.<P>
Other subsections detail the physical transportation of device and transaction data, answer to reset and 
transmission protocols. The specifications permit two transmission protocols: character protocol (T=0) 
or block protocol (T=1). A card may support either but not both. <P>
(Note: Some card manufacturers adhere to neither of these protocols. The transmission protocols for 
such cards are described as T=14. That is technical shorthand for "proprietary protocol." Such cards 
conform neither to ISO 7816 nor the EMV specifications.)<P>
<H4>3.4.2. Part II: Data Elements and Commands</H4>
This part defines data elements and files, the commands required to execute financial transactions and 
terminal requirements. When data elements are exchanged between cards and terminals, they become data 
objects. These objects can be simple or complex depending on how they have been processed. All data 
objects reside in data files. <P>
Data files in a card, when viewed from the terminal, appear in a tree structure whose main branches are 
application definition files that are application-specific. This structure allows diverse applications to be 
maintained separately within a single card. It also provides a point of entry to an application and a logical 
framework to attach data files specific to an application.<P>
The commands that pass between cards and terminals are defined in terms of message structure, coding 
conventions and logical channels. Commands are application-specific and begin with a fixed-length header 
followed by a variable-length body. Application Protocol Data Units, or APDUs, pass between cards and 
terminals in a command-response format. These commands authenticate cards and terminals; they also 
read, verify and manage data.<P>
This part also contains three detailed annexes: Data Elements Table, Data Objects and Secure 
Messaging.<P>
<H4>3.4.3. Part III: Transaction Processing</H4>
This part defines the content and flow of payment transactions for both cards and terminals, establishing 
common core functions for international interchange transactions. However, card issuers may also create 
functions that are unique to specific applications and payment systems.  Mandatory data objects and data 
files must be present for cards to conform to EMV specifications. Cards and terminals may also use 
optional data objects that are contained in data files defined by these specifications. If these options are 
exercised, they must conform to the specifications.<P>
One subsection describes the flow of transactions. Smart card transactions normally occur off-line, but 
there are procedures that facilitate on-line interactions under certain conditions. Another subsection 
details the functions used to process transactions.<P>
Part III concludes with an annex, Coding of Data Elements, and an Application Selection Example in a 
second annex.<P>
