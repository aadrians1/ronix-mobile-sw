<H3>SKIPJACK Declassified<IMG SRC="new.gif"></H3>
Skipjack is nice if you need a strong cipher in a
microcontroller which doesn't have much memory.  A software
implementation on an 8 bit processor is simple and needs only a tiny
amount of RAM, plus 256 bytes of ROM for the F table.  The key setup
time is zero.  It's more complicated then TEA, but it doesn't require
32-bit shifts which are a pain on the 8051.<P>
It's reasonably efficient, compact, easy to implement on 8-bit processors,
and needs only 3 or 4 bytes of RAM besides the data block (the key
would normally be in EEPROM).  I don't know of any other published
ciphers that have gotten any serious cryptanalytic attention that are
this good for small microcontrollers.  The one that comes closest is
the GOST block cipher, which requires 32-bit rotations, 256 bit keys,
has various other types of bogosity.  Skipjack looks better than DES
in this situation in just about every way: it's faster, needs less ram
and code space, and is more secure because of its longer keys.
<P>
The usefull information about SkipJack include:

We present here <A HREF="skipcpp.txt">C++ implementation</A>,

<A HREF="skipjav.txt">Java implementation</A>. When implementing
SkipJack by itself you will need some

<UL>
<LI>The new group called <A HREF="http://www.scard.org/">Smartcard Developer Association</a>
was founded. They chacterized themselves: <BR>
 "<I>The Smartcard Developer Association was founded when experts in the
 field of security software realized that there was little
 non-proprietary information about smartcards available.  Many software
 developers wish to simply use a smartcard, rather than create their
 own.  Smartcard development tools are expensive and vendor specific.
 Cross-platform diagnostic and development software is virtually
 non-existent.  This situation is especially difficult for developers
 wishing to use existing smartcard technology rather than develop their
 own solutions.  The SDA seeks to remedy this situation.</I>"
<LI> <B>GSM SIM Cracked</B> 
 <BR>The <a href="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu">ISAAC security
 research group</a> and the <a href="http://www.scard.org">Smartcard
 Developer Association</a> announced a flaw in the authentication
 codes found in digital GSM cellphones.  This allows an attacker with
 physical access to a target phone to make an exact duplicate (a ``clone'')
 and to make fraudulent calls billed to the target user's account. <BR>
 More detailed information about the attack is located
 <A HREF="http://www.scard.org/gsm/">here</a>.

 The "secret" algorithm for GSM authentication and key establishment 
 <A HREF="http://www.scard.org/gsm/a3a8.txt">A3/A8 or 
 COMP128</a> is now published on the internet.

<LI>"Magazine articles like to describe cryptography products in terms of algorithms and key
 length. Algorithms make good sound bites: they can be explained in a few words and they're
 easy to compare with one another. "128-bit keys mean good security." "Triple-DES means
 good security." "40-bit keys mean weak security." "2048-bit RSA is better than 1024-bit
 RSA." But reality isn't that simple."<BR>
 It says Bruce Schneier in his interesting article
 <A HREF="http://www.counterpane.com/pitfalls.html">Security Pitfalls in Cryptography</a>.
<LI>Barclays Bank in England warned shoppers to be on
 guard against credit-card fraud. Although losses have been
 dropping, theft using cloned (counterfeit) cards are large
 enough at 23.6M pounds (about U$40M) to warrant
 investment in smart cards. In the UK alone, said a
 Barclays' spokesman, over half a million retail points of
 sale will have to be converted to interact with the
 microchips on the new credit cards.
 <BR><I>Source: PA News</I>
<LI>The European Union floated a proposal for a smart card
 that would double as a bank card and as a universal
 identity document. Some anti-EU British politicians
 immediately branded the proposal as a threat to British
 sovereignty and a threat to civil liberties.
 <BR><I>Source: PA News 1/21/97</I>
<LI>The National Criminal Intelligence Service of the UK
 publicly stated that the growth in electronic commerce and
 specifically the coming widespread use of electronic
 money (e.g., the smart card systems of Mondex) will open
 an enormous vulnerability in the economy. Digital
 counterfeiting would likely be impossible to distinguish,
 said Gareth MacLachlan, head of the Organised Crime
 Unit of the NCIS; he emphasized the value of integrating
 full audit trails into all forms of electronic money, including
 electronic "cash" system that are designed at present to
 provide anonymous financial transactions. Dr James
 Backhouse of Computer Security Research Centre at the
 London School of Economics agreed, saying, "The biggest
 impact would be the loss of any audit trail. Most bank
 transactions leave some trail within the system and this
 would be lost."

<LI>On May 1st 1998, will be launched the world’s largest organized
    attack against EuroCrypt pay-TV channels, in an attempt to break the encryption
    used on a number of film, sport and general entertainment packages.

<LI>Differential fault analysis (DFA) is a powerful attack on crypto systems embodied in devices
