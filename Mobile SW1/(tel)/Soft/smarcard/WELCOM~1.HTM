<p><font size="6"><b><tt>Welcome to my pages on Motorola GSM
phones</tt></b></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b><tt>I am in no way affiliated with
Motorola Inc. These are NOT official Motorola pages</tt></b></font></p>

<p><tt>In order to make these pages evolve and grow, I need more
information. If you have information or documentation of any
kind, please share it. I will treat any information I receive as
confidential (you might consider using pgp) - anonymity is
guaranteed. There are still many gaps and holes that need to be
filled - please help me in trying to do that. The things that I
am especially interested in is the DSC bus and the emmibox (any
details, comm protocols, firmware dumps etc.). I need information
on the BIC &amp; MODEM&nbsp;IC. Of course all this is for
academic purposes only and my lips will remain sealed (or as a
prominent writer of cryptography software once said: &quot;They
will have to pry the pgp passphrase from my cold, dead
neurons...&quot;).</tt></p>

<p><tt>Everyone can help. I need feedback for the software
version, test mode command, IMEI (TAC+FAC) and battery lists. If
you have information that is missing in those lists, please help
me keep them up to date. These pages should not be viewed in a
resolution less than 800x600. Please read the copyright and
disclaimer.</tt></p>
