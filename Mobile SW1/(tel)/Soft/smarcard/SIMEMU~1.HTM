SIM emulator in turbo pascal. It emulates the file serving part
of a SIM card AND the GSM authentication routines (COMP128). With
the software and a very simple computer (RS-232) to phone
interface (top left in the picture), it will allow you to make
your own virtual SIM card where there are no restrictions to what
SIM files can be updated. Normally only someone with the SIM
administrative code are allowed to update certain files such as
the administrative file - When the SIM is emulated, then *</tt><font
size="4"><tt>YOU</tt></font><tt>* are in charge and there are no
restrictions as to which fields can be changed - AD, ATR, etc..
The circuit board in the middle is a smart card adaptor that was
used to log trafic between phone and SIM during (the ongoing)
development of the program. The program does not require much
computing power - a 16 MHz 286 will do just fine.<br>
Giulio Cesare (designer of the interface boards) has a </tt><a
href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/7875/simemu.html"><tt>page
describing them</tt></a><tt> (only in Italian for now). There are
many places that sell complete season interfaces(eg. </tt><a

or </tt><a
href="http://www.crownhill.co.uk/testequi.htm#ISO 7816 Interface"><tt>Crownhill</tt></a><tt>),
that are easy to modify into a ASIM interface(</tt><a
href="http://www.g7hid.demon.co.uk/motorola.htm"><tt>G7HID</tt></a><tt>
demonstrates just how). An even simpler </tt><a

needs a single 7400 has been deseigned by George Terziysky.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Files for emulating a Motorola test and clone card are
inluded with ASIM (sim.dat and clone.dat). Look at the pages
describing the test and clone card for more information. The
clone card frames can be saved in motorola S19 or binary format
and can be edited within ASIM. The framebuffer has a size of 4K.
COM port and language is defined in the *.dat file.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Here are a few hints:</tt> </p>

<ul>
    <li><img src="warning.gif" width="20" height="20"><font
        color="#FF0000"><b><tt> BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE CLONE
        FEATURE AND DON'T USE IT AT ALL IF YOU ARE NOT 100% SURE
        WHAT YOU ARE DOING! It SHOULD be needless to say that by
        transferring and especially editing transfer frames, you
        are performing brain surgery on your phone - Many of the
        registers WILL crash your phone if they are changed so
        use these tools with extreme caution ! REMEMBER: Frames
        are as the rule *not* compatible across
        &quot;platforms&quot; </tt></b></font></li>
    <li><tt>Use these tools at your own risk. You have been
        warned !</tt></li>
    <li><img src="warning.gif" width="20" height="20"><tt> If a
        transfer for some reason does not complete, then
        DO&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;POWER&nbsp;OFF&nbsp;THE&nbsp;PHONE. Load
        back the original frame before you do !</tt></li>
    <li><tt>Specify the first 5 numbers in the IMSI as 00101
        (reserved for test use) to avoid the phone registering
        (and getting rejected)</tt></li>
    <li><tt>Change the phone language selection away from
        &quot;automatic&quot;</tt></li>
    <li><tt>If you use an external powersupply for the interface,
        be sure to isolate it from the SIM Vpp line !</tt></li>
    <li><tt>Check the COM post setting in the .dat file - the
        default setting is COM 3</tt></li>
    <li><tt>If you encounter problems, try using it under DOS
        (not a DOS window)</tt></li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b><tt>FIX !</tt></b></font><tt>
        - Some people are experiencing trouble using ASIM with
        the newer phones, here is a fix: You must first power on
        the phone without the interface card present, then load
        clone.dat, execute the clone emulation option, and then
        insert the interface into the phone (while phone is
        powered). </tt></li>

<p><font size="5"><b><tt>Editing of transfer frames</tt></b></font></p>

<p><a href="mailto:tst@iname.com?subject=MEDIT"><font
color="#0000FF" size="5"><tt><u>TST</u></tt></font></a><tt> has
made a really, really neat program that will let you edit the
menu configuration easily as well as editing the phonebook with
ease and uploading your own wakeup graphic screen to the phone !
Have fun with it, take care and remember to send me copies of
your frames and customized graphics ! Do not use with 7200 and
older phones. Read the excellent documentation before you try to
use MEDIT. MEDITX is a hybrid between ASIM and MEDIT - MEDITX
will let you do everything from one program with command line
parameters.</tt> </p>

    <li><img src="warning.gif" width="20" height="14"><tt> If you
        manage to enable the Chinese, Thai or Korean language

        It has shown to crash 8400 &amp; 8700's - Only the 8500

    <li><tt>Turbo Pascal 7.0 has a bug in regards to really fast
