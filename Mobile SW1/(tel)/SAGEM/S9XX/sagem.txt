(for ALLSG.HEX)
connect clk of sim card connector to pin 2 of pic
connect i/o of sim card connector through 1K Om R to pin 6 of pic
get gnd for pic from somewhere and Vcc for pic from battery of phone
tested for 8xx and 9xx series including new soft releases
warning : there is 10 Om R connected to i/o of sim card connector - must be replaced with 1K Om

for different phones (I mean 8xx and 9xx) mounting scheme is slightly different but who care...
