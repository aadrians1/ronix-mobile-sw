 These are the goals that were used in designing the flash/EEPROM
programmer:

1. The more inexpensive the better

   When you can buy programmers fully built in the $100US to $150US
  range, a useful circuit should be $50US or less. A programmer and
  chips that don't require ultraviolet for the erase cycle helps
  to meet this goal.

2. Easy to build

   The more wires needed for connections the less likely anyone will
  want to build it. Heavily using serial interface techniques keep
  wiring low while minorly affecting performance.

3. Reliable operation

   Proper powerup & powerdown techniques should be employed to
  protect the device to be programmed during installation & removal.
  A high impedance should be present on each pin during these times
  to guard against false writes and pin input damage.
   This is the most important goal because it adds predictability
  to the programming process.

 Unfortunately due to these goals, this programmer has several
disadvantages:

1. Slow

   Programming a 29F040 (4mbit flash) is reported to take
  20 minutes to program on a Pentium 133.

2. Won't program any EPROM chips

   Because no voltage higher that 5 volts is used in this
  circuit, the programming of EPROMS is not possible.
