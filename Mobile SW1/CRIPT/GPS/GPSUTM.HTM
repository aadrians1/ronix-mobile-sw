<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>
(N.B. This Guide started as a text posting to re.backcountry Feb. 10, 1995)<br>

Most of the articles and literature on the Global
Positioning System have only described the use of a GPS unit in a
nautical setting. As valuable as they are on water, they are
equally as valuable in the bush, desert, mountains, tundra, or,
just in Central Park.

<p>
This therefore is written for hikers, fishermen, hunters
and all persons who wish to traverse the wilderness in the full
knowledge of where they are, where they have been and where they
wish to go, primarily in conjunction with a gridded map.

<p>
In this discussion, I will at times use "GPS" to mean the
actual hand held unit itself as opposed to the whole system of
satellites and their control.

<p>
The most basic requirements for land use of a hand held  GPS are: 
     
<p>
1. The ability to give a position reading when not unduly impeded
by overhead tree cover, thus virtually requiring a multi  parallel channel
receiver unit such as the Eagle Explorer or Garmin 12XL.

<p>
2. The capability to store at least 100 way-point (WP) positions in
the unit's memory.

<p>
3. The ability to list these WP positions giving their distance
and  direction from the current position. 

<p>
4. If to be used with gridded topographical maps, the unit must be
able  to handle the most common UTM datum. (explained later.)

<p>
Any added features are a bonus but not necessarily
needed, depending on the intended use. The "odometer" function
of some units can be useful, also the Track-back.

<p>
Also, being able to upload/download way-points and routes to a
computer may be important to some but is not vital for the
occasional use of a GPS.      

<p>
All of the units have  many other features, most of a
nautical nature which may or may not be useful on land, depending
on the circumstances.   

<p>
The basic requirement for the ease of use of a GPS on
land and the correlation of the readings directly to a map require
that the GPS be capable of handling the UTM grid system (Universal
Transverse Mercator grid). While there are other grid systems in
use, the UTM system is by far the most common. Within the UTM
system, there are many map datums specific to the area of interest.
(More about this later.)

<p>
When we have roads, power lines, heights of land, mountains, rivers 
and lakes, these
are often sufficient along with the map and compass for us to
establish with a reasonable degree of accuracy, where we are on the
map. In those featureless areas however, where all looks the same
for miles and miles of slowly rolling bush-land, grassland,
dessert, tundra etc. the GPS takes over and will give a definitive 
location which may be found and plotted on the map. 

<p>
The usefulness of a GPS is now well recognized by many people
and the interest is increasing all the time. As a result, there are
those who do not know how to use a compass and map but, who after
buying a GPS feel that they now have the ultimate tool for ease of
travel in backcounry. A GPS is just another aid to traveling, high
tech, yes, BUT must be used in conjunction with at least a compass
and hopefully a detailed gridded topographical map. While using a GPS
 greatly
assists in traveling in featureless areas, it does not mean
that there is no need to still maintain an independent record of
way-points, routes and directions in case of a system failure.<br>

<CENTER><BLINK>WARNING</BLINK></center>

No one should venture out in any area where being 
lost would present a danger with only a GPS. It is
essential to carry spare batteries, a compass and 
a map and to have the knowledge of how to use them.   
This message is so important that those who read this
should pass it on to others, now that GPS receivers 
have dropped to less than $100 US and will be bought 
on impulse.
</strong>    


    
<P> See the tutorial now available at:<br><br>
<center><a href="http://www.uio.no/~kjetikj/compass/"> Kjetil's
Compass Lesson</a></center>
                                                                  
<P>
I always travel with a compass in the bush as the
compass compliments the GPS and saves its batteries. I don't always
have a map with me. The GPS should not be left on and used in place
of a compass when on internal battery power in the wilderness
unless there is an ample supply of batteries! This theme will be
repeated several times in this article for it is important.


<P>
Like any other sophisticated instrument, a GPS unit is only
as good as the person using it. A lack of knowledge of the
limitations of the GPS system is responsible for many of the
reports of so-called unit/system failure. 
<P>

I've had a (now outdated) Garmin 75 for over 4 years, having used it
extensively in northern Ontario and Quebéc. It was extremely useful 
and I found it more than accurate enough for my needs. If I could get a clear
spot with a fair sized "window" to the sky, my readings would be
within 100 metres (110 yards) 95% of the time, usually much less.
I am now using a Garmin 12XL, ver. 4.0 and it is an impressive unit. <br><br>

<a name=limitations></a>

<h3>LIMITATIONS</h3>

<P>

A GPS antenna will not receive good signals from within
a building. Likewise, leaves and branches of trees will interfere
and degrade the signals with the result that the readings, if any,
are slow to obtain, if at all. Some of the more sophisticated units 
(meaning multi-channel receiver units) are better at obtaining readings 
under these conditions than others, there is a price to pay. The price 
a few years ago was in weight, power consumption and cost. Now it is really 
only the cost.

<P>

The GPS system has been is use for a number of years and
used by sailors and pilots, with great success. BUT, in an airplane or
on a boat, the sky is in view, from horizon to horizon. Any GPS,
even the least sophisticated, lowest price model single channel multi-
plexing unit will give good results under these perfect conditions. In
addition in most planes and boats, an external power source is available.
<P>

To expect a single/double channel hand held unit to perform
under conditions never experienced on sea or in the air is ludicrous.
Yet, this is exactly what many new users have done. As a result,
specific makes and individual units have both been given a bad
reputation and said to be unreliable. Much of the blame 
here belongs directly on the various manufacturers who have not
adequately explained in their advertisements, literature and
manuals, the limitations in the system and requirements for use. 
In addition, misleading claims for the accuracy of units and the
system are made in some of the mail order catalogs and some
staff in stores have been known to give faulty information. The
best defence when buying a GPS unit is have a good understanding of 
the system and the differences in the units - which is no different
than buying anything such as a car, computer, stereo system or whatever.

<p>
Now that most newer units have at least 12 parallel channels,
the speed of obtaining a usable reading is only a fraction of
the time that the older multiplexing units needed and the
frustrations experienced by earlier users will be minimized.     

<P>        
From four seasons hunting and fishing in the Canadian
bush with my single channel unit, I've found that the readings are 
always sufficient for my needs, if I take the time to pick a clearing 
with as much sky and horizon showing as possible and take readings about 
every 1/2 hour. While the unit that I used is perhaps twice the cost of
the lowest priced units currently available, I have little doubt
that the lowest priced units today would also perform almost as
well, while possibly lacking some of the more sophisticated
features.(Note: the above applies to multiplexing units and was
written before the multi-channel parallel units became the standard.)<br><br>
<p><center><a href="#table">Back to Table of Contents</a></center>

<hr size=2>

<a name=accuracy></a>

<h3>ACCURACY</h3>

<P>      
The GPS satellites are owned and controlled by the US
Department of Defense and this agency has the prerogative  to 
degrade the  accuracy  for purposes of national defense. This is
done by what is called "Selective Availability" or what is commonly
known "SA." SA is normally turned "on" but the DOD says that 95% of
the time, position accuracy will be 100 metres or better.
 
<p>
Let me say as a Canadian, who is very grateful for the GPS satellite 
system paid for by US taxpayers, that the SA does not in any way impair
the systems usefulness for my purposes. And even if SA were to disappear
tomorrow, the gain in accuracy would still not be sufficient for me to 
do my own surveying, to mark a hidden treasure or to find a bow-hunting
tree-stand in the middle of a cedar swamp at 4am in the morning. 

<P>
The SA introduces a position error which changes over a
period of time. A unit will not, when stationary, give a continuous
stable reading. The position will gradually change and if the
screen page chosen also shows speed, it will show a slow speed reading as 
well. This is normal when SA is on. 

<P> 
By recording these readings over a number of hours (or even days)and
averaging, a reading will be obtained that is quite close to the
correct one. Several of the more sophisticated (and expensive)
units will do this automatically but such accuracy is not needed
for the general user. 

<P>
Very sophisticated systems are used by surveyors where
the accuracy is excellent, often with two units working in tandem. 

<P>
DGPS is a system whereby the GPS unit receives
corrections by way of radio signals from a GPS unit at a known
location. While most hand held GPS units are said to be "DGPS
Ready," that is for hook-up, this is  most commonly used by boats. 

<P>
There is the possibility that the US DOD will bow to US civilian 
pressure and turn SA "off" which will give users accuracy
of perhaps 25 metres or a bit better.

<P>      
If you intended to bury a treasure and come back in five years
to dig it up, then a simple GPS would not be the answer by just
taking a reading. Instead, take a reading on a feature that you
will recognize easily from at least 50 to 100 yards. Then take a compass
bearing and measure with a tape measure to the treasure and record
the coordinates (of the recognizable feature), the bearing
(compass direction) and the distance. Another way to accomplish 
this would be to choose two ground features readily recognizable
and to take compass bearings from each to the treasure.

<p>
There is some evidence that different makes and models of various 
GPS units are slightly more accurate than others. To explore
this, check into Tom Born's website listed in the links at the end.<br><br>

<h3>HOW THE GPS WORKS</h3>

<P>
This explanation is not technically exact but will give the basic idea of 
how it functions. 

<P>
The GPS unit does not send out radio signals, it only
receives them. There are some 24/25 navigation satellites in orbit
about 12,000 miles above the surface of  the earth, and more will
hopefully be added. Each makes an earth orbit every 12 hours.

<P>
Each satellite knows from reference to land based control
stations where it is at any given instant.  Likewise, it knows the
exact time in UTC (Universal Time Coordinated, formerly Greenwich
Mean Time). Each satellite also has the "almanac" which gives the
same information about the other satellites as well their own orbits.

<P>
When you turn on your GPS and point the antenna to the
sky, it starts picking up signals from the satellites, starting
with the strongest signal. It then cycles (if it is an older multiplexer)
through the others in sight gathering more info. If it is a newer
multi  channel parallel unit, when four channels have good data,
it will then calculate its distance from each of the satellites to itself.
<br>
<P>
Let's say it reads three satellites and knows the
distance from each one to itself. If you picture a satellite for a
moment stationary, with a line the length of which is the same as
the distance from GPS to the satellite, if you extend this line to
the earth, you could trace a circle which touches the earth's
surface making  a circle or an arc, depending whether or not it is
overhead or towards a horizon. You and the GPS are somewhere on
that arc or circle. Now with the line from a 2nd satellite, you
have another circle or arc on the earth. You are at either of the
two points where the two arcs or circles intersect, but which one?
The third satellite settles the matter and you will have a
position. At this point, you will be given a position reading,
Garmin calls this 2D mode, that is, no elevation update. If a
fourth satellite is in view, it brings more precision to the
calculation and an elevation will be given, that is 3D mode.

<P>
For a good   positional fix, the required four satellites should be 
located around about yet well above the horizon.
Unfortunately, the  opposite is true for an elevation reading.
In the latter case, the satellites should be more overhead. Generally
speaking, the GPS system does not give accurate enough readings of
height to be useful, the error being normally 150% to 200% of the
horizontal error - for example, if the position error is 50
metres, the elevation error could be 75 to 100 metres.

<P>
Depending on the type of roof, some units have receivers
and antenna sensitive enough to obtain a usable signal inside and
these are the ones which will do best under heavy tree cover,
usually the multi channel types. 

<P>
With respect to the speed of giving a reading when turned,
on the oftener a GPS is used, the faster it will give a reading.
The first time that a new single channel unit is used it could take 
up to 15 minutes for a reading! This is termed a "cold" start and has
nothing to do with the temperature. Once it has the initial reading
and orients itself, it will take much less time. Normally, after
20-30 minutes, less than a minute is needed for a reading (a "hot"
reading). Also while the lower priced units such as the older Garmins
(38, 40, 45, and 75) and Magellans have only one receiver which switches
from satellite to satellite, the more sophisticated units
(Eagle, Trimble,  Garmins and now Magellan) have a sufficient number 
of receivers to read the transmissions from the four required for 3D fix.

<P>
I will add here that I have heard two divergent opinions
expressed about 2D and 3D fixes. A 2D fix is the initial fix
calculated when the signals from only 3 satellites are strong
enough to be used. My Garmin 75 will give a 2D fix usually quite
quickly and when an additional satellite contributes it's data, 
the fix will become a 3D fix. A 2D fix does not give an altitude or
uses the last that it calculated whereas a 3D fix also gives the
current elevation. One opinion is that the initial 2D fix is as
accurate a position  as a later 3D fix. The contrary opinion is
that 2D fixes are unreliable. While I have done no work to
establish  which is correct, I lean towards the 2D being acceptable.
Remember, I'm not expecting 20 metre accuracy. To be safe, it is
probably good practice to wait for a 3D fix.

<P>
The newest multi parallel channel  units are very fast at obtaining
a fix, usually within less than 1/2 a minute whereas the older 
multiplexing units will take at the best, four times as long,
but the newer units will not necessarily give more accurate fixes,
all else being equal. <br><br>

<h3>BEWARE</h3>

<P>
With the advent of 12 channel units (Eagle Explorer and Garmin  12XL)
there is a lot of misinformation floating around, particularly concerning
the older and now much cheaper single or dual channel units.

<P>
Tracking 8 or 12  sats is NOT the same as having 8 or 12 parallel
receiver channels in a unit! And to make it worse, some sales people
either through ignorance or worse, will state that a unit tracking
12 satellites is a 12 channel unit.  Not so!

<P>
My old Garmin 75 "tracks" up to 8 sats but it only reads data from one sat
at a time and must cycle through them to get data from four for a fix.
It is much slower than a Garmin 12XL which has 12 parallel channels.

<br><br><p><center><a href="#table">Back to Table of Contents</a></center>


<hr size=2>

<a name=dop></a>

<h3>DILUTION OF PRECISION - DOP</h3>

<P>
Some GPS units will give you an idea of the quality  of
the reading. Usually it is called DOP for dilution of precision, as
in my Garmin 75. Also given is a average  error in metres or feet.
Some other makes call this the Position DOP or PDOP.

<P>
The lower the DOP number, the more accurate is the
reading. A DOP of 2.5 or 3 is OK, at least for practical bush
travel. I have seen it as low as 0.9 but this is with an almost
clear horizon and good satellite coverage. (And don't ask me why
the DOP can be less than 1.0.) 

<P>
Because the satellites are moving across the sky,  when
a reading is attempted under tree cover, they will move in and out
of sight quite rapidly. This is where a unit with parallel
receivers excels because it takes much less time (about 1/4 as
long) to have enough data to work out the fix. As mentioned
earlier, it is the moisture in the leaves which absorbs the signal
(or more correctly, the dissolved constituents of the moisture.)

<P> 
You will at this point ask, but what about rain, fog and
clouds. I had only one report, high in the Swiss Alps, where the
user felt that fog was degrading the signal. In this case, the fog
was extremely heavy and was possibly degrading it. On
the other hand, evidence is that weather does not unduly affect the
accuracy of the units in rain or when there is cloud cover. 

<P>
There are at times a brief period when not enough
satellites are in sight and positioned well enough to give an
acceptable reading, especially in hilly  wooded country. Usually
within 20 minutes or so however, a useful reading is possible. Fortunately,
this is not common. I have rarely experienced this but a friend also
with a Garmin 75 has more frequently seen it. When such a configuration
of satellites does give a local problem, it will probably be experienced
again about an hour later the next day. 

<p>
For those readings taken on water, with a clear horizon and good geometry 
of the satellites, the reading will be much  better, as will be the altitude
but, who needs altitude at sea?<br>
Note: a sea level elevation reading of a minus figure is not necessarily
a system or unit error but involves the distance to the center of the 
earth at that point, not the distance above the actual water surface.

<h3>ELEVATION -(ERRORS)</h3>

<P>
Generally, the elevation errors will be great enough  to make the readings 
useless.<BR>
A GPS is not to be depended on for accurate elevation readings.

<P>
For those of you who are fortunate enough to own a
hand-held altimeter, don't expect the GPS to take its
place.

<H3>SA AND HOW TO DEFEAT IT - THE BLOB</H3>
<p>
<P>
An interesting experiment is to turn a unit on, set it to
record "track" on the "Plot" screen and after an interval of at
least 60 minutes or longer if possible, check the plot of the track
that the unit records. As the "track" is recorded by
the pixels on the screen, it will draw an uneven "blob" with the
position of the unit in the center of the screen. If you leave it
on until the "+" (at least on the Garmin 75) appears to be well
centered in the blob, take an immediate reading and you will have
the best reading that you are ever going to get with SA "on" and a
simple unit. I call this the Blob method of achieving an accurate
fix. It is not my discovery but that of a contributor to the Usenet
group: <EM> sci.geo.satellite-nav</EM>


I understand that some units, the newer Garmins, permit the "+"
on the plot screen to be moved (panned) and if so, it could be
centered on the blob in order to take the reading, not waiting until the 
blob centered itself over the "+" in the center of the screen.

<H3>DIFFERENTIAL GPS - DGPS</H3>

<P>
Where DGPS radio stations broadcasting the corrections
to be applied because of SA are locally available, and  these corrections 
are fed to the GPS unit, accuracy is much improved, perhaps giving an 
error of 20 metres instead of closer to 100. <br>
I don't view differential corrections of any practical use for my hiking, 
even if they were available.

and longitude and struggled making the conversions back and forth
between the map and the GPS. In realizing that there had to be a
better way than this, I found the relationship between the
topographical map grid (UTM) and the GPS. 

<P>If UTM gridded maps are available, don't waste time fooling
around with Lat. & Long, at least on land. 

<P>On the other hand, if you already have an older GPS that does not
handle UTM, all is not lost but you will need to use latitude
/longitude.  This is fine for bush work without a map. But for ease
of conversion from map to GPS and back, you can't beat a grid
system, UTM being by far the most common. 

<P>Although most of the world has been mapped using UTM in one
datum or another, gridded maps are not always available being
kept to the military in some countries.

<P>
On checking Bowditch, <cite>The American Practical Navigator</cite>,
1977, a standard marine text, reference is made to the fact that
some harbours of the world have been mapped with the UTM grid
and such maps are available.

<H3>MAPS</H3>

<P>Most maps have latitude and longitude and can be used by
making the calculations between degrees, minutes and seconds.
However, the topographical maps of scales, from 1:100,000 down to
1:50,000 and below usually also have the entire map gridded with
the UTM system. Whenever possible, only purchase these maps. The
Canadian topos in the 1:50,000 series, have a grid 2 cm. square,
which is 1 kilometre on the ground. This means that each mm. on the
map is 50 metres (or about 55 yards). If your map is not 1:50,000,
check the scale to establish the grid size.  While 1:24,000 US
topos are gridded at 1,000 metres ( 1 kilometre), I have seen a US
Forest Service 1:100,000 map with a 10 kilometre grid! Likewise,
the Canadian 1:250,000 maps have a grid too course for practical
work.  

<P>The newest USGS topos show a 7.5' X 15' rectangle on a scale
of 1:25,000, metric, using NAD 27 UTM.
They are available mail-order from:

<P>
USGS Map Sales, Box 25286, Denver, Co. 80225 and cost $4
each plus $3.95 shipping for each order. 

<P>
Also, many hiking and outdoor shops carry local maps.

<P>There has been some talk of the USGS dropping the UTM
grid from their maps and only leaving a + where the intersections
occur.

<H3>TRAVELING</H3>


<P>When traveling any great distance, when I stop for gas or a
coffee, I take a GPS reading, not saving it. This is because when
first turned on, the GPS remembers where it was the last time that
it was used.  When it finds that the satellites are not where they
should be, it must then  update its data and work out the new
calculations (a cold start). This might take a couple of minutes.
There is no need to save this point. By doing this on the trip,
when you arrive at your destination, the GPS will rapidly give a
reading (a hot reading).

<P>Since writing the above, I have found that my Garmin
75 will give a reading from a cold fix after moving hundreds of miles
within 2 to 3 minutes, with a good view of sky. 
	
<P>If you have hooked up the unit to the car electrical system,
then you may have continuous read-outs right to your destination.

<H3>WAY POINTS -WPS</H3>

<P>Way-points are locations worth recording and storing in a GPS.
They may be check points on a route, significant ground features,
e.g. camp, the truck, a fork in a trail, where Charlie shot his
deer, or whatever. They may be put in manually, having taken the
data from a map. This can be done before ever leaving home. Or more
usually, they may be entered directly by taking a reading with the
unit at the location itself, giving it a name and then saving.  
They may also be put into the unit by reference to a WP already
stored, giving the reference WP, the distance and compass bearing
to the new WP.<br>

<!--If I said where we are moose hunting here, it might get crowded next year :-)-->

<P>Arriving at a new camp, the GPS should be turned on, and the
location stored at CAMP. As the days unfold and more territory is
explored, more way-points are named and stored. But be selective of
those that are saved. Too many can be very confusing. Better, a
small number of good ones than too many poor ones. In this regard,
before you store any, think out a nomenclature. For example, a
series on a trail could be TR1, TR2, TR3..... and RD1, RD2, RD3....
for a road. With a series like this, you could plot them later on
the map and draw the trail or road.

<P>With a GPS, a person may explore a new  territory as he
wishes, without having to worry about becoming lost. The GPS, after
locating itself, will give the distance (in kilometres or miles)
and direction (magnetic course, true course or grid course) for the
nearest 10 or so way-points. Say that you want to go to camp. The
GPS says 3.4 kilometres at a direction of 120 degrees. Turn off the
GPS, head out about 120 degrees with compass in hand and walk the
easy route. You do not need to travel 120 degrees exactly. Walk
around each hill and swamp. After traveling for a while in the
general direction, turn on the unit take another GPS reading and
check distance and direction now to CAMP. You will find you are now
only 2.2 kilometres but must head 145 degrees. You now can turn it
off and alter your course further south. You repeat this until the
distance drops to within 100 or so metres. You are now within the
circle of error which is due to SA and camp should be within sight.

<P>Remember, these units are mostly all oriented for nautical use
and as such, when left ON, will do a GOTO and give continuous
updated readings of direction to go and remaining distance to the
destination. They will in effect "navigate" all the way. BUT, this
technique presupposes that you have ample battery power (external
hook-up) AND a clear view of the sky. This technique is standard
procedure on the water and worked well for Dessert Storm. (No, I
wasn't there  but SA was turned OFF and I just can't picture the
guys fumbling with a new set of AA's when in a vehicle. "Hey, Joe
grab that pink bunny and shak'm down for some  more coppertops, or
we gunna miss the party in Bhagdad.")

<P>BUT this "navigation" with a live hand held GPS in the
wilderness where topography and tree cover can give intermittently 
poor reception in my opinion is a NO NO. I believe that much of the
frustration of some new users is because they are asking too much
of the system and units under much less than ideal conditions.<br>
While this advice of not "navigating" on land was pertinent with the
units of several years ago, since 1997 and the lower battery drain
of current units, it is not as important and indeed is  acceptable,
remembering the need to always carry spare batteries. But in doing so,
much that is to be seen will be missed if too much focus is on the GPS 
and not more on the terrain  and scenery.<br>

<H3>UTM - AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN</H3>


<P>Here is the exercise that I went through to discover how to
use Universal Transverse Mercator grid system.

<P>If you already have a GPS with way-points stored
in Lat-Long, have no fear of losing them in the following exercise.
The GPS will convert them back and forth effortlessly. 

<P>For the Garmin 75, from the AUX screen, choose UNITS/HEADING
and cycle through the options for Posn>,  choose UTM/UPS. (At this point,
you are not yet worrying about the Datum. This is explained later.)

<P>Now with a gridded map of your location, go OUTSIDE and take
a reading. (I am certain that these directions, with some
modification will work with all hand-held units).

<P>Wait until you get a 3D reading, and the speed on the
navigation drops to zero or close (it will continually vary because
of SA) and appears something like this: 
<PRE><code>       
        18T 0439535
            5024750
</PRE></code>

<P>Record this reading, turn off GPS and go inside to the gridded
map, put a pencil mark on your location (hopefully you know where
you are)! If you look along the edges of the map, you will see that
the grid lines are numbered. Look at the lower left hand corner of
the map. You should see a 6 digit number, printed horizontally with
the 2nd and 3rd digits printed slightly larger than the others. The
larger numbers are the ones relating to the vertical grid lines and
will increase from left to right. Look again at the lower left
hand corner and left of map, printed vertically will be another 
number with 7 digits, the 3rd and 4th printed larger. These are the
numbers increasing from bottom to top numbering the east/west grid
lines. Now with the grid numbers on the map and what you recorded
from the GPS, look for the relationship. Look at the grid numbers
along the bottom of the map and see how they match up with the
first number, e.g. <code>0439535</code> above.  

<P>Close to where my house is on the map, the grid line 39
appears along the map bottom. Likewise, looking at the grid numbers
going up the left (and right) side of the map, I see 24 which is
also close. My house is east and north of where north-south grid
line 39 and east-west grid line 24 cross. The difference east and
north of the 39 and 24 crossing is given by the last 3 digits in
each number, e.g. 535 meters east and 750 meters north.     

<P>As I said earlier, the UTM grid on the map is the key to
coordinating the map with the GPS.  By using it, you can easily go
back and forth with an accuracy of 50 meters or about 55 yards on
a 1:50M map. You will do even better on larger scale map.
The UTM grid has been in use for many years. To understand the
grid, imagine instead of longitude, that the north-south lines are
based on meridian lines 6 degrees apart. These strips are 6 degrees
wide, centered on these meridians, starting at 180 degrees west and
numbered towards the east.

<P>Thus, all of North America (with the exception of the western
Alaskan islands) is covered by those zones numbered from
#5 to #22. Here in Ottawa, I am in zone 18.  Where we hunt moose is
zone 16, to the west. Yellowstone Park is in zone 12. In referring
to the grid, it is important to know what zone you are in and in
giving a UTM reading, the GPS  will give the zone first. The
letter, T in this case, is the UTM reference to how far north or
south of the equator you are.  In normal use you can disregard the
zone number and letter.

<H3>USING UTM COORDINATES</H3>


<P> In using UTM grid coordinates, the "easting" from the zone
meridian is always given first, and then the "northing".  Also take
note that for UTM, measurement is from the west, going EAST, the
"easting" which is opposite to longitude. In reading coordinates,
you <em>READ RIGHT UP</em>.  In other words, the easting is always given
before the northing. The coordinates of a point could be given
several ways. Here is an example:
<PRE><code>
       18T 0439535 5024750
</PRE></code>
<br>

<P>This is the full location description of my home in Ottawa to
the best precision the Garmin 75 will give. (NB-I have redone it
by the "Blob" method and it is actually <code>18 T 0439426  5024376.)</code>
The 18T refers specifically to the area of the earth where I am
located, and normally is not used. The other 14 digit number must
be broken up:

<P>
<code>0439535</code>   is the EASTING from the zone 18 meridian,  down to
the closest metre.  If you place a decimal thus:<br>
<code>0439.535</code>. (The leading 0 is redundant as EASTING
only needs 6 digits). 

<p>To the right of the decimal is <code>0.535</code> of a
kilometre or 535 metres  and to the left are whole
kilometres, 439. In practice, <code>0439.535</code> could be
used as 395, dropping the 04 at first and rounding
the 0.535 to 0.5 and ignoring the decimal. While
the decimal in not written and the 5 refers to 500
metres or 0.5 of a kilometre, this gives a ground
precision of 100 metres, about the same as the maximum 
error introduced by SA.

<P>
Thus<code>5024750</code>   for the NORTHING becomes 247

<P>
I could therefore say I live at<code> 395247</code> in the Ottawa area (or on a
map showing the 18T UTM area) which  gives an accuracy to within
100 metres (110 yards). (This six digit reference system has been
used for years by the military to designate targets, objectives,
rendezvous points etc. I learned it in high school cadet classes
during WW2 but forgot all about it until I rediscovered it with
GPS.)

<P>Taking into account the possible 100 metre error due to SA, a
6 digit UTM coordinate is really all that is needed.

<P>It will be recognized that there will be a repetition in
numbers going from one location of the country to another. To
alleviate this confusion, in using 6 or 8 digit coordinates, the
map must be identified. If not, then the whole number must be
given, e.g.<code>18T 0439535 5024750</code>  

<P>A grid coordinate usually has an even number of digits, the
first half being the easting and the balance, the northing. But,
when the number of digits after the zone (<code>18T</code> here) is odd, e.g.
<code>18T 439535 5025750</code>, the extra digit belongs to the northing.

<P>
As a matter of interest, the northing, <code>5025750</code> in the above
example, is the distance in metres north from the equator. The
metric system defines the metre as 1/10,000,000 of the distance
from the equator to the north pole. As a verification of this, I
live close to 45 degrees north, half way from the equator to the
north pole and my northing is 5,025 kilometres. 

<P>
If you refer to a UTM grid on a map, of either 1:50,000 or
1:100,000 scale, the grid squares will usually be 1 kilometre (1000
metres) to a side. It is simple to estimate between grid lines to
1/10 or 100 metres.  For closer precision, on a 1:50,000 map, each
1 mm.  is 50 metres on the ground. On the newest 1:25,000 US topos,
1 mm. would represent 25 metres on the ground. Note, the most common
Silva compasses have a mm.  scale on one side and this may be used to
measure east from a grid line and north from the E-W grid lines.
<P>
<P>
Here is a very helpful diagram drawn by Sam Wormley (see links below)
who posted it to <i>sci.geo.satellite-nav</i> in Januray 1996.
<P>
It represents the UTM grid on a typical topo map. The "x" on the
map would be described in UTM as <code> 597562,4402255</code>. The
grid numbers on a real map will of course only be found on the
map edges.

<P>Note: there is some distortion in the above diagram and the
rectangle formed by the grid lines in reality is a square.
<P> All of this sounds much more complicated than it really is. It
is harder to explain in words than to take a map and demonstrate. <br><br>

Remember, I said that with UTM, you <em>READ RIGHT UP</em>
that is you do the Easting and then the Northing.<br>
<p>
The blue numbers along the bottom margin are the grid numbers for the 
Easting. The first whole number is 424000m.E The 24 is 
emphasized because this is the number which goes up by 1 for each  N/S
grid line going to the right, e.g. East. The line of 424000m.E
is 424 Kilometres East of the base line for Zone 18. Thus going from the line
numbered 24 to that to the right, 25, is one kilometre or 1,000 metres.<br>
<P>
The same applies for the blue numbers going up the left margin, the first line
being 5095000m.N which is 5,095 Kilometres North of the equator.

This is the difference in hours between GMT (it isn't
really GMT as it is off by  slight bit- a technicality)
and local time. If you want your unit to show your local time,
then you must put in an offset.<br>
Here in Ottawa on EST, the offset is
-5.00. This must be changed when you go to DST, in
summer, my offset is -4.00.<br>
In Europe, say Finland, the offset would be a positive number.<br>
Whether you input an offset or not makes no difference to the
unit in using the system data.

As I said above, it is not exactly GMT but very

function accurately is that all SATs and your unit
are using exactly the same time. You do not need to
set the clock in the unit. It is done automatically
when you turn it on and it starts picking up satellite
signals. Instead, set your watch from the GPS!

MAP DATUM

<P>
PRE-DEFINED
<Blockquote>
I am using NAD27 Canada for most of my maps although
some of the newer one are NAD 83. If you choose a datum different
than used by the map, your coordinates will not agree. If you find
the GPS does not agree with the map coordinates, check this.
</Blockquote>

<p>
<Blockquote>
If you examine your topo map carefully, you should find the map
datum given . On my 1:50M older Canadian topos, at the bottom in
fine print, just to the right of the map name and the scale, it
states "North American Datum 1927". The newest map dated 1995 gives
North American 1983 (which is essentially same as WGS 84). I
therefore have my unit set to the NAD27 Canadian datum but would
change for to NAD 1983 or WGS 84 for the newer map.
Similarly, on a US Forest Service 1:100M maps, on the lower right
hand corner, it states "Universal Transverse Mercator Projection
1927 North American datum". This is sufficient reason to reset the
GPS to the NAD27 datum. Therefore, check a map over carefully to
find out what datum is used and set the GPS to it. The Garmin comes
set with WGS 84 which may be left as is but if you compare a
reading with a map using NAD 27, you will find a discrepancy
of 100 metres or so in the easting and a smaller one in the
northing.

<H4>BUYING A GPS</H4>

<p>
WHAT FACTORS TO CONSIDER?

<P>
Size is a factor and some are a good hand full but they are getting
smaller. The Garmin 45 is about the size of a 110 camera! The Garmin 
12 is even smaller.

<P> 
HOW MANY SATELLITES WILL IT TRACK? 

<P>
Please be sure at this point that you understand that for a unit
to "track" 12 satellites does not mean very much. For an older or
lower priced unit which must multiplex because it has only a single
channel or even two channels, the unit should  track
at least 5 satellites but more is better. However,
these units while tracking satellites, must sequentially
cycle through the 4 best to obtain a 3D fix (that is, with
elevation). The various models of GPS track from 5 to 12 satellites 
The more satellites that a unit tracks, the quicker it will choose
the best 4 and switch if necessary. The Garmin 40/45 and lower
priced Magellans only track 5  whereas the 75 tracks 8.
This gives the 75 an advantage when conditions are difficult.

<P>
Most of the small hand held units can only process the data from
one satellite at a time, no matter how many they are tracking. This
being the case, the unit must cycle through the satellites one by
one before giving a reading. Parallel processing units have the 
advantage.

<P>
But all of the above is academic because the newer multi parallel channel 
data from channel parallel units don't just "track" the sats, they receive

each one AT THE SAME TIME! thereby speeding up the whole
process of the unit working out a position fix. While I can appreciate
someone wanting to buy a unit which only multiplexes (no matter
how many sats it tracks) because of the low price, e.g. under
$100, I feel that this is false economy and suggest the purchase
of only a multi parallel channel  unit, such as the Garmin 12,
12XL, III, Eagle Explorer etc. I do not recommend any Magellan
units until the confusion of whether or not their units are or
are not multi-channel parallel units is completely settled.
 

<P><H4> 
MULTI PARALLEL CHANNEL UNITS - WHERE THE ACTION IS! </H4>

<p>
With the newer units which have multi parallel channel  processing (Eagle 
Explorer and newer Garmins such as 12, 12XL, II, III are good examples), it 
means that the 5 (or more) best SATs are being tracked and data from the 4 
best <STRONG> processed</strong> at the same time which in practice means 
faster fixes, particularly under difficult conditions e.g. wet trees.
Previously, the trade-off was that they used more battery power than the 
older multiplexers, were usually larger and cost more. But that has all 
changed and these new units are much easier on batteries than older single 
channel units!

<P>
It should  store 100 or more way-points, (250 is common).

<P>
The capability to store several Routes is an asset. Most store
10, 20 or more.

<P>
A unit must  be able to use UTM grid data or a local grid if available.
In north America, topo maps are almost always have a grid whereas
in some parts of the world, only the military have access to such
maps. The Garmins handle over 100 different UTM map datums. If you have
access to UTM gridded maps and wish to use them, then by all means look
for a unit that will serve your needs and handles those UTM maps
datums needed. Most units may be set for the common datums used
worldwide. There are however some areas where the topographical maps 
are based on a datum which is not found on some units. 

<p>     
The descriptions in some catalogs refer to M.G.R.S. standing for
Military Grid Reference System. This is a newer grid reference
system, similar to UTM if not the same.

<P>
BATTERIES
<p>
(The following was written in 1995 before the newer smaller
units reduced their power needs) 
Most will operate on either 3 or 4 AA cells. None of them are
easy on batteries. My Garmin 75 uses 4 AA (I like the Rayovac
Renewal Alkalines, see below). The Magellan Trailblazer only
uses 3 AA cells whereas the Eagle AccuNav Sport needs 6!
Remember, you will be carrying spares and these units, even
the smallest are heavy enough without batteries.
Some makes go through batteries faster then others.
Another point against a unit using more than 4 AA cells is  
that the small chargers like the Rayovac Renewal only hold 4
AA cells. More than 4 cells could mean twice a long to      
recharge! In choosing batteries, the best bet would be
Ray-o-Vac Renewals or Pure Energy (sold in Canada), which are
rechargeable alkalines. (I have been using Renewals now for 3
years, same ones, 3 sets.) Nicads I have tried and don't like.
They don't put out the volts and then there is the "memory"
problem.   

<p>
With my rechargeable alkalines, I top them up when ever
possible. This is not possible with nicads. Also alkalines 
will hold a full charge in storage better than  nicads. They
are also cheaper.
<p>
If you are going to use the unit in extreme cold, try and
get lithium batteries. Radio Shack and some battery specialy
shops carry them however, they are very expensive. 

<P>
<strong><H4>ALWAYS CARRY EXTRA BATTERIES</strong></H4>
<Blockquote>
          WARNING- Some units, e.g., the older Garmin 40 & 45 (but
not the 75) and at least some Magellans have no internal lithium
battery to maintain data when the unit is turned "off." They therefore 
need to have the batteries in place at all times, even when turned off. 
They will hold data for a little while when you change batteries. This 
makes it all the more important to carry extra batteries. The newer
Garmins e.g. 12XL, 12, III etc. have a lithium battery which recharges
from the AAs, even when the unit is turned off. 
</blockquote> 

<P>Leave fresh (new or fully charged) batteries in your unit but occasionally
check to be sure that they are up-to-strength and not leaking.

<P>
As an extra thought to the above, it would be prudent to
record in a log-book the coordinates of important way-points and the
compass courses between them just in case your batteries fail or your
unit becomes inoperable. In the event of GPS failure, system or unit,
your will be able to extricate yourself.

<H3>HOOKING UP TO AN EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLY</H3>

<P>
Since this article was first written in February 1995, I 
have mounted my G75 in my Explorer, drawing on the car battery.
I bought a BNC cable from Radio Shack so that I may place the 
antenna externally on a rear side window or set it on the dash
board on the passenger side. In initially getting a fix, the 
external antenna mount is quicker but once locked on the SATs,
the dash board location works fine. It gives me direction of
travel in magnetic (or would do so in Grid or True), speed as
well as the UTM coordinates as they change. The plot screen will
give the track I have made as well.

<P> 
This is a great set-up for mapping the bush roads we use in the 
north in the fall. The passenger notes the coordinates and plots
them directly to the map while traveling. If you only record a six
digit WP (to a precision of 100 metres), you can plot very quickly
while traveling. If working alone, I save each turn as a numbered
WP to one route. Later, I can extract the WPS's and plot the route. <br> 
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="http://www.synapse.net/~dbartlett/hondagps2.jpg"HEIGHT=150 WIDTH=150 ALT="GPS ON A HONDA ATV" >
</CENTER>

<p>
With the newer units such as the Garmin 12XL, the same can be
accomplished automatically.

<P>
If your unit does not have an external antenna and you wish to
use it on the dash board of the car, turn the unit on outside
the car and wait until it gets a reading before bringing it inside 
and placing it on the dash or in a mount. 

<p>
The windshield on some cars has a metallic coating through
which the GPS can't receive the weak signals from the satellites.
In such a situation, you can change cars or, cheaper, use an
external antenna outside the vehicle. 

<p>
If you are going to use the unit in a vehicle or boat, then be
sure to get whatever you need to hook into the electrical system
and save your AA pack.

<H3>SPEED</H3>

<P>
Given that the system can guide flying cruise bombs at whatever
speed they travel, most units will have no trouble tracking a hiker
or boater. Note however that the Garmin 38,40, 45, 45XL & 75 are
limited to 99 MPH, a speed that is useless for aircraft but does not
seem to hinder the sail plane pilots. I have tried my Garmin 75 on the
dash board of a truck at 60 MPH and the speed reading was more
accurate, I am sure, than the speedometer of the car. Also, it was
giving changes in position, heading, and keeping a plot. This is
great fun but drains the AA cells very quickly, unless plugged in
to the car electrical system.

<H3>VARIABLE READINGS</H3>

<P>
A GPS left on and stationary will give a continuous but variable
reading. This is not an error in the unit, just that SA is
continuously altering and/or degrading the accuracy. A series of
readings over many hours when averaged will come very close to the
correct figures. N.B. See above how to defeat SA over a period of
time using the Blob system.

<P>
I am fortunate in Ottawa to have access to a bench mark),
the location of which is exactly known. While testing my unit, I
took ten readings over 3-4 minutes. By using the Pythagorean
theorem, I worked out the hypotenuse (or error) for each of the 10
readings and the average was about 5 metres (5.5 yards) off! This
was NOT a scientific test and my good results were as much chance
as anything. What it means is that during the period that I took
the readings, SA just happened to have a minimum error. Next time
I try it, I could be off 60 metres, or 100 or perhaps much more!

<p> 

If you are fortunate enough to find a BM, the exact location of
which is known, you can conduct the same test. Usually a BM's
location is given in latitude/longitude. Enter the BM as a WP with
the unit set for lat/lon, change the unit to UTM, then take your 10
or more readings, and record the differences in easting and northing
from the correct reading. For each pair of differences, square
them, add them together, take the sq. root of the product and this
is the distance in metres that that pair of readings varies from
the stated position.

<P>
Note: The Ottawa BM is called "Babbage" and found at N 45-19-43.5
and W 75-52-1.2, on Corktown Road at entrance to Nepean Municipal
Campground. (Note: I give the lat/lon as these coordinates in UTM
would vary depending on the Datum (e.g. NAD 27, NAD 83 etc.)

<P>
Some of the teckies with a hook-up between the GPS and a
computer have done the same thing taking hundreds of readings and
then applied statistical analysis to come up with guidance as to
what degree of accuracy can be expected for different sampling
rates and the time period. For me, I the Blob is accurate enough.
(For those who have done these studies, I'm just jealous that I don't
have the expertise and equipment to conduct them!)
 
<P>
It is important to stress however that one should not depend
on obtaining accuracy of better than 110 yards/100 metres with SA.
Generally, the accuracy will be better than this but you can't
count on it. With SA OFF expectations are that the error will drop
to perhaps 20 metres.

<H3>HOW NOT TO USE YOUR GPS</H3>

<p>
In the fall of 1995, I read an account of a man with a new GPS who 
took a reading (WP) of his car, then went on a long hike. To return to
the car, he did a GOTO on it, leaving the unit on to give
direction and distance. When he got within 100 yards or so of
he car (which was hidden in bushes), his GPS was pointing every
which way. It took him some hours to find it.

<p>
Why?

<p>First of all, he should have parked near some feature which
could be identified from 50 or so yards away. His car could not
be seen from 20 or 30 feet away! Secondly, he had no compass and
relied on the GPS completely for direction. When he got close to
the car, he was expecting accuracy better than the system can
yield because of SA. He also used up his batteries and his
buddies were less than impressed with him and GPS.

<p>
Because of the inaccuracy introduced by SA, if a WP is saved and
a return to it is made, in theory, the error could be of the magnitude
of 200 metres! That is a 100 metre error when it was saved added
to the 100 metre error when trying to find it. So what is the answer?
Quite simple, if you have a spot that you must find e.g. the car
and there are no easily seen geographical features, make a a line,
perpendicular to the road for 100 or so yards on each side of
it, intersecting at the car. (I am not suggesting blazing the trees or
using a spray bomb but the use of surveyors' tape or toilet paper,
which will also degrade in time.) When the GPS says you are
within 100 metres of the car, TURN IT OFF and use your compass to
go back and forth until you hit the road or the marked line. 

<p>
There is also the technique used by those skilled with a compass to
navigate. They aim either to left or right of the objective and when
it is reached, turn and follow the coast, road, trail or stream
on which it is located. 
<br>
<br>
<a href="#back">Back to UTM- AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN</a>


<p>
In buying a unit, if you are unsure of how well your needs will be
served, try and obtain a commitment from the seller that you may
exchange the unit for another make or model if need be.

<p>     
This has been written in an effort to assist in making the
right purchase decision and to shorten the learning curve in using
a GPS. I have been accused of being biased towards Garmin and UTM.
I make no apology for these  perceived biases. The Garmin 75 is the
only unit with which I have any lengthy experience. As for UTM,
where gridded maps are available, to use lat/lon is masochistic in
the extreme. 

<p>
I have deleted much unit specific information and readers if they
understand what I have explained here, will be able to make an
intelligent choice of a unit.

<p>
The information I have given is thought to be accurate but I
assume no liability for errors, omissions or for someone getting into
difficulties in using a GPS and this guide.

<p>
I have no connection with Garmin or any retailers although I can recommend
