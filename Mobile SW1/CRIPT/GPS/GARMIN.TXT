This is a description of the GARMIN-GARMIN protocol as spoken by the
Garmin GPS-75 GPS receiver and the Garmin PCX5 MS-DOS software.  The
information here has been determined by observing the communication
between the two units while sending "chosen plaintext".  This spec is
at best, incomplete, and at worst, incorrect.  Lots of assumptions
were made based on the observed behavior of the protocol.  It is also
unknown how much of this protocol is common to other Garmin products.
But, unless Garmin decides to be cooperative, this is about the best
we can do.  Use it at your own risk!

All references to GPS-75 behavior came from William Soley.  A major
update to this was made in July, 1996 by Eric Werme, studying the
behavior of his GPS-45.  There is much in common between the protocols
used by the two models, but there are differences.  Much of Werme's study
focused on protocol commands not used by PCX5, all of which are subject
to change, even between revisions of firmware within a model!  If you
must rely on some part of the protocol, it should be part that is used
by Garmin's PCX5 software.

Layer 1
-------

Data is standard Async.
9600 bits per second.
8 data bits.
no parity.
1 stop bit.


Layer 2
-------

The data stream consists of frames each having the following format:

	DataLinkEscape (0x10)
	RecordType (one byte) $$
	Length (one byte)  ** $$
	DataField ("length" bytes) ** $$
	CheckSum (one byte) **
	DataLinkEscape (0x10)
	EndTransmission (0x03)

** - fields indicated by "**" are subject to escape.  Any occurrence of
a DataLinkEscape character (0x10) in these fields is preceded by
another DataLinkEscape (0x10) resulting in a pair.  Escape bytes added
in this way are not counted in the record length (i.e. bytes are counted
before the escapes are added).

$$ - the bytes comprising fields indicated by "$$" are summed and the
low-order 8 bits are then negated (2's complement) to form the
CheckSum.  Any added DataLinkEscapes are not included in the sum.

Software processing this protocol layer on input can discard the initial
DataLinkEscape, the checksum and later bytes, and compress the double
DataLinkEscapes into one.  The remaining bytes constitute Layer 3 protocol
frames.

Layer 3
-------

When a non-ACK/NAK or asynchronous frame is received an ACK or NAK is sent
depending on the checksum validity of the received frame.  ACK/NAK frames are
the same format as a regular frame:

	RecordType = 0x06 (ACK) or 0x15 (NAK)
	Length = 2
	DataField = RecordType of record being acknowledged, 0x00

When a non-ACK/NAK frame is sent, the sender waits for an ACK/NAK.  If
a NAK is received, or if no ACK is received after about 1 second, the
sender retransmits the frame.


Power Up
--------

When the GPS-75 is powered on, it transmits an 0x5A character.
When the GPS-45 is powered on, it transmits 0xFE and 0X5A characters.

Holding the <CLR> button while pressing <PWR> to turn the unit on
will erase the unit's memory and result in the messages:
	Stored Data Lost
	Searching the Sky

Holding the <ENT> button while pressing <PWR> to turn the unit on will put the
unit in TEST mode.  The GPS-75 a will display a series of concentric
rectangles will be displayed and animated to give the illusion of passing
through a tunnel.  Pressing <ENT> will toggle between the tunnel display and a
display showing:
	Testing ...
	Sgnl Amplitude  2168
	TCX0 Drift   -19.978
While in TEST mode, a continuous stream of RecordType=0x00, 0x01,
and 0x0d messages will be sent to the serial port.
Also, while in TEST mode the "<" and ">" may be used to adjust
display contrast, but the adjustment does not appear to be saved.

The GPS-45 behaves somewhat differently.  The status screen is the first to
be displayed and includes a keypad test test feature.  In addition to the
box display is an all black display.  The GPS will send a stream of
RecordTypes 0x00, 0x27, 0x28.

Data Presentation
-----------------

Numeric data within the Garmin protocol is in binary, and several formats
are used.  Those are described here.  Skimming this section now will make it
easier to understand the protocol's commands.

short integer	- length = 2 bytes, in order of increasing significance.
		  Negative numbers are expressed as 2's complement.
		  Examples:
			00 00 = 0x0 = 0
			01 00 = 0x1 = 1
			10 00 = 0x10 = 16
			00 01 = 0x100 = 256
			00 10 = 0x1000 = 4096
			ff ff = 0xffff = -1
			f0 ff = 0xfff0 = -16

long integer	- length = 4 bytes, in order of increasing significance.
		  Negative numbers are expressed as 2's complement.
		  Examples:
			00 00 00 00 = 0x0 = 0
			01 00 00 00 = 0x1 = 1
			00 01 00 00 = 0x100 = 256
			00 00 01 00 = 0x10000 = 65536
			00 00 00 01 = 0x1000000 = 16777216
			ff ff ff ff = 0xffffffff = -1
			f0 ff ff ff = 0xfffffff0 = -16

float		- length = 4 bytes, IEEE single precision floating point.
		  Least significant byte first.  This format consists of:
			1 bit - sign
			8 bits - exponent, excess 127
			23 bits - mantissa, implied high-order 1

double		- length = 8 bytes, IEEE double precision floating point.
		  Least significant byte first.  This format consists of:
			1 bit - sign
			11 bits - exponent, excess 1023
			52 bits - mantissa, implied high-order 1

ASCII string	- series of ASCII bytes, usually padded with blanks.
		  Example:
			47 50 53 20 37 35 20 20 32 2e 32 31 20 = "GPS 75 2.21"

date/time	- length = 4 bytes, long unsigned integer encoded as 
		  86400 + number of seconds since midnight, Jan 1 1990.
		  Note:  unix_time = garmin_time + 631065600
		  Examples:
			00 00 00 00 = 0x0 = undefined
			80 51 01 00 = 0x15180 = Jan 1 1990 00:00:00
			7d f0 ef 2d = 0x2deff07d = Jun 4 1994 03:09:49
			
#
# date/time information is ignored when uploading to garmin.
# When downloading, the only records that have a nonzero time
# field are trackpoints. (tested with GPS45 and  GPS II+)
#			

long lat/lon	- length = 4 bytes, long signed integer encoded as
		  11930464.7111111111 * lat/lon in degrees, or
		  683565275.576431632 * lat/lon in radians.
		  The former factor as a ratio is 2**30/90.  As a C
		  expression, it is ((1L << 30) / 90.0).
		  All values are in map datum WGS 84.
		  Examples:
			00 00 00 00 = 0x0 = 0.0 deg
			61 0b b6 00 = 0xb60b61 = 1.0 deg
			00 00 00 40 = 0x40000000 = 90.0 deg
			00 00 00 c0 = 0xc0000000 = -90.0 deg
			00 00 00 80 = 0x80000000 = -180.0 deg

#
# For some garmin models the 6 least significant bits are ignored.
# This doesn't make much precision problems as the resulting error
# is below 1.2m but you have to be careful when rounding numbers.
# You might get some "pentium-results", e.g 4.9999345 instead of 5.0
# For a DMS output the least significant number is 0.1s. Anything
# smaller is garbage due to the numerical representation in the
# garmin protocol.
# 


double lat/lon	- length = 8 bytes, IEEE double precision floating point
		  encoded as lat/lon in radians.  All values are in map datum
		  WGS 84.

		  Examples:
			00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 = 0.0 rad
			00 00 00 00 00 00 f0 3f = 1.0 rad
			00 00 00 00 00 00 f8 3f = 1.5 rad
			00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 = 2.0 rad
			00 00 00 00 00 00 08 40 = 3.0 rad
			00 00 00 00 00 00 f0 bf = -1.0 rad
			00 00 00 00 00 00 00 c0 = -2.0 rad

----------------------------------------------------------------
RecordType = 0x0c	EndTransfer
Length = 2
DataField =
	2 bytes - unsigned short - type of transfer being ended

		04 00 = 0x4	= routes
		06 00 = 0x6	= tracks
		07 00 = 0x7	= waypoints
Description:
	This record is sent following the last data record of
	an upload or download to denote the end of the transfer.
	When the GPS receives this, it removes the "<num>
	of <num> packets" message.

----------------------------------------------------------------
RecordType = 0x0d	Event
Length = 4
DataField =
	2 bytes - EventType

		10 00	Screen message displayed
		14 00	Power on sequence message
	
	2 bytes - SubType
		This is a function of the EventType.  Each known EventType
		is described below with a list of the SubTypes.

	4 bytes - GPS clock time
		This is a time that is initialized to 0 at startup and
		incremented 255750 per second.  This is 1/4 of the
		1.023 Mhz bit rate of the CA code transmitted by GPS
		satellites.  (Rumors that GPS satellites are powered by
		Apple ][ computers are totally untrue!)  Some events may
		use the low one or two bytes for additional data.

Description:
	Sent asynchronously while in TEST mode or when enabled
	by the RecordType=0x1C command, with mask 0x02.  There
	are other possible values of EventType but we haven't
	figured them out, yet.  Those seen from the GPS-45 but
	not understood are listed at the end of this document.

	SubType list:
	EventType 05 00	Satellite acquired
		This is sent when a satellite is acquired.  In diagnostic
		mode (Enter held down while powered on) or on the GPS-38
		This coincides with the satellite signal strength bar changing
		from white to black.  The SubType field is the satellite ID
		number - 1.

	EventType 07 00	Navigation quality
		The subtype is either 2 or 3 for 2D or 3D navigation.

	EventType 0c 00	Keyboard event (TEST mode only)

		The subtype is a message code.  This list is from the GPS-45,
		but not all messages can be generated.  This message coincides
		with the message being posted on the GPS.

		00 00	Can't Change Active WPT

	4 bytes - long latitude
	4 bytes - long longitude
	4 bytes - date/time created
	40 bytes - ASCII comment - blank padded
	4 bytes - IEEE float - alarm radius in meters
Description:
	This record is used when uploading or downloading
	proximity waypoints.  A RecordType=0x1B (BeginTransfer)
	is sent specifying the number of waypoints, followed by
	the specified number of ProximityData records, followed
	by a RecordType=0x0C (EndTransfer) record.
----------------------------------------------------------------
RecordType = 0x15	NAK
Length = 2
DataField =
	1 byte	- copy of RecordType from record being NAK'd
	1 byte	- always zero
Description:
	The recipient is expected to retransmit the last record
	immediately when it receives an NAK.  NAK is not sent in
	response to ACK or NAK.
----------------------------------------------------------------
RecordType = 0x1A	SatelliteStatus
Length = 0x38
DataField =
	8 instances of ...
	1 byte	- satellite ID number - 1

Description:
	This record is sent before the first data record of an
	upload or download to denote the beginning of transfer.
	It causes the GPS IO setup display to display "<num>
	of <num> packets".  If you send waypoint, route, track, or

		ff ff = 0xffff	= enables all (all bits set)
Description:
	GPS responds to this request with RecordType=0x20 then
	0x09.  If no DataField is present, appears to have same
	effect as a mask of 0xffff.  This command enables
	asynchronous reporting of the selected events.  Not much
	is known about the enabled RecordTypes because this is not
	used by the PCX5 software.
	WARNING: AsyncEvents appear to stay enabled across power
	cycles and can confuse host software if it is not expecting
	to receive them.
----------------------------------------------------------------
RecordType = 0x1D	RouteData
Length = 0x15
DataField =
	1 bytes	- route number

	number of records, followed by RecordType=0x1D (RouteData)
	RecordType=0x1E (RouteWaypointData) records, then a
	RecordType=0x0C (EndTransfer) record.

#
# On newer garmin models the length of the 0x1E record is 0x3C.
# The 2 additional characters contain:
#
# 1) 0x00...0x0F corresponding to the icons on the map display.
# Looking at the icon selector of the garmin you see 16 icons
# arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns.
# The icons are nubered as:

# 0x00 name and symbol
# 0x01 symbol only
# 0x02 comment and symbol
#
#

= The GPS III series has more symbols than the GPS II series
= and uses new two bytes for the symbol
= Also after the comment there are 4 more bytes (set to 0)
= The length of the 0x1E record is 0x41

Length = 0xD
DataField =
	4 bytes - long latitude
	4 bytes - long longitude
	4 bytes - date/time recorded
	1 byte - 01 if first record in session, else 00
Description:
	This record is used when uploading or downloading track.
	A RecordType=0x1B (BeginTransfer) is sent specifying the
	number of track data records, followed by the specified
	number of TrackData records, followed by a RecordType=0x0C
	(EndTransfer) record.
----------------------------------------------------------------

DataField =
	6 bytes - ASCII waypoint name - blank padded
	4 bytes - long latitude
	4 bytes - long longitude
	4 bytes - date/time created
	40 bytes - ASCII comment - blank padded
Description:
	This record is used when uploading or downloading way-
	points.  A RecordType=0x1B (BeginTransfer) is sent
	specifying the number of waypoints, followed by the
	specified number of Waypoint records, followed by a
	RecordType=0x0C (EndTransfer) record.

#
# On newer garmin models the length of the 0x23 record is 0x3C.
# The 2 additional characters contain:
#
# 1) 0x00...0x0F corresponding to the icons on the map display.
# Looking at the icon selector of the garmin you see 16 icons
# arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns.
# The icons are nubered as:
#
# 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03
# 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07
# 0x08 0x09 0x0A 0x0B
# 0x0C 0x0D 0x0E 0x0F
#
# 2) The second character may contain 0x00 0x01 or 0x02
# corresponding to the display mode:
# 0x00 name and symbol
# 0x01 symbol only
# 0x02 comment and symbol
#

= The GPS III series has more symbols than the GPS II series
= and uses new two bytes for the symbol
= Also after the comment there are 4 more bytes (set to 0)
= The length of the 0x23 record is 0x41

= The route waypoint record is exactly the same with the 
= exception of the id (second byte) 0x1E instead of 0x23.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------
RecordType = 0x2A	SatelliteSelect
Length = 0x02
DataField =
	2 bytes - Satellite index
Description:
	The GPS-45 has a sequential receiver, meaning that it looks at one
	satellite at a time.  The eight satellites that can be processed are
	in a table (see RecordType 0x1A).  As the firmware switches from one
	satellite to another, this message marks the event.  The data field
	is the index (0 to 7) into the satellite table for the satellite.
----------------------------------------------------------------
RecordType = 0xFE	IdentificationReq
Length = 0
DataField =
Description:
	The recipient, presumably a GPS, is expected to transmit
	its Identification and Software Version as RecordType=0xFF
	(IdentificationData).  GPS-75 appears to ignore the DataField
	if one is supplied, but the PCX-5 software always transmits
	a DataField of one byte always containing 0x20.
----------------------------------------------------------------
RecordType = 0xFF	IdentificationData
Length = 0x12
DataField =
	2 bytes	- unknown - 17 00
	2 bytes - unsigned short - SoftwareVersion * 100
		(e.g. dd 00 = version 2.21)
	14 bytes - ASCIZ Identification string
Description:
	This record is sent in response to RecordType=0xFE
	(IdentificationReq).
	
#
# Newer garmin models have a 0xFF record with different length.
# The ID string is longer than 14 bytes. For correct processing
# of 0xFF records read the record length and subtract 4 to get
# the actual length of the ID string.
#	

----------------------------------------------------------------


Example: Identification Request
-------------------------------

-> 10 fe 00 02 10 03
<- 10 06 02 fe 00 fa 10 03
<- 10 ff 12 17 00 dd 00 47 50 53 20 37 35 20 20 32 2e 32 31 20 00 62 10 03
-> 10 06 02 ff 00 f9 10 03

The first message, 10 fe ... is a command to the GPS to identify
itself.  The second message, 10 06 ... is the GPS acknowledging the
command.  The third message, 10 ff ... is the GPS sending the response
containing its identification (the ASCIZ string "GPS 75 2.21" begins
in the 4th byte of DataField).  The fourth message, 10 06 ... is the
acknowledgment to the GPS of the response message.

The GPS-75 appears to ignore the DataField of the 0xFE command, however,
the PCX5 software appears to always send a DataField of 0x20.  (The
example above is shown with a null DataField.)

Much remains to be understood.  This section summarizes messages we
don't know.  These messages are generated asynchronously in response
to various bits in the data field (mask) of the RecordType=0x1C command.
