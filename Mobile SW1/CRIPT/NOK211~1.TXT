My ascii isn't great so a word of explanation. The left symbol (O)  is the
antenna connector for car kits. The symbol numberd 16-9 on the top and 8-1 on
the bottom is the system connector. the ( ) is the open space next to the
connector and the ( o ) is the charging connector for you home-charger.

As you can imagine. YOU CAN DESTROY YOUR NOKIA BY FOOLING AROUND WITH THESE
CONNECTIONS. Therefor I accept NO responsability for any possible damages. My
advice to you is to think twice before doing something and if you are going to
try make use of a car-kit holder to get access to the X100 connector since it
is to tiny to use a self-fashioned connector.

IT IS POSSIBLE TO REPROGRAM THE NOKIA 2110 as is indicated by the pinout
description so watch it !
