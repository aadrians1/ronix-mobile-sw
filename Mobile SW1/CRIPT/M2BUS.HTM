<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The normal FBUS interface uses the pins 7 and 8 of the phone (the pins
  nearest to the ejected rightmost pin 9). The FBUS interface is used for
  example by Nokia Data Suite<SUP>TM</SUP>.</P>
  <P>There is another way to communicate with the phones, called M2BUS. The
  M2BUS is located on a single pin, pin 6 (the fourth pin from the right
  keyboard facing up).</P>
  <P>There is no clear reason to build an M2BUS cable, because the applications
  sold for phones (Nokia Data Suite<SUP>TM</SUP>, Nokia PCComposer) operate
  via FBUS. Only the Nokia Service Locals require the M2BUS interface for
  tuning and testing the phone.<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE><B><I>Note</I>:</B>
  The Nokia Data Suite<SUP>TM</SUP> application uses only the FBUS transmission
  method. If you are building an extra cable for your NDS, please prefer
  the <A HREF="fbus.htm">FBUS-only circuit</A>.<HR ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>This solution uses a soft-switch to switch between the FBUS and M2BUS
  modes. The FBUS mode is selected by leaving the RTS (Ready To Send) unasserted
  and M2BUS is selected by asserting the RTS. Wrong setting on the RTS line
  does not damage the devices but prevents the communications. It seems to
  be that the RTS circuit is used to indicate the use of the M2BUS in Nokia
  software.</P>
  <P>Because the adapter output will be connected to the M2BUS pin of the
  phone, there will be one new problem: The internal 5 kohm pull-up resistor
  of the phone M2BUS pin creates a voltage divider with the 1 kohm limiter
  resistor of the adapter. This problem occurs when the MAX232 R2OUT pin
  is low, i.e. the adapter tries to pull the M2BUS to zero volts. It would
  be better to have as small resistance as possible on the R2OUT pin, but
  lowering the resistance would increase the current through the 2V7 zener
  diode and through the phone &quot;pull-down open collector style&quot;
  M2BUS driver, which is not a good thing. - When the phone wants to pull
  the M2BUS to the ground, the communications protocol ensures that the R2OUT
  pin of the MAX232 is always at high level simultaenously and the current
  flows also from the MAX232 (in addition to the normal current from the
  internal pull-up of the phone).</P>
  <P>In my tests the M2BUS idle voltage with the adapter connected was 2.30
  volts. When the computer wanted to pull the bus to zero, the result was
  0.66 volts and when the phone pulled the bus down, the voltage was 0.20
  volts. The critical thing is that the phone must understand 0.66 volts
  as &quot;0&quot;.</P>

  versus the FBUS-only adapter. Please read the <A HREF="fbus.htm">FBUS-adapter

  <P>Please note the component ratings and notes in the <A HREF="fbus.htm">FBUS-adapter
  document</A>.
  <P>Use an IC socket for MAX232. Please note that in the circuit board layout
  shown in the figure 4 the pin 11 of the IC socket must be cut away.
  <P>If you are going to use this adapter with a Nokia 5100/6100 series phone,
  you must connect the Rx &amp; M2BUS to pins 6 and 7, Tx to pin 8 and GND
  to 9 in the connector of the phone. The pin 9 is the rightmost pin when
  the phone base is watched with keyboard up.
  <P>The circuit is now ready for testing.

  <LI><B>Testing the Dual-mode Circuit<BR>
  </B>After you have built and checked the circuit (the polarity of the capacitors),
  test the circuit. <B>Do not</B> connect a device (phone) to the adapter.
  <OL>
    <LI>Connect the adapter to computer. <B>Do not</B> insert the MAX232 yet
    into the socket.
    <LI>Open HyperTerminal (or equiv.) and set the device to corresponding
    COM port and set flow control to &quot;none&quot;. Type some dummy characters
    to the terminal.
    <LI>Measure the voltage between the pins 15(-) and 16(+) of the IC socket.
    It must be about 4.7 volts.
    <LI>Choose Call - Disconnect from the menu. The voltage disappears.
    <LI>Insert the MAX232 (check the direction).
    <LI>Type several characters to the terminal to switch the power back on.
    The characters should appear on the terminal window. (The adapter successfully
    converts the V.24 data to 3 V and back.)
    <LI>Check the voltage of pins 2 (about 8.5 V) and 6 (about -8.4 V) of the
    chip. Use GND for the - probe.

  <P>If you do not get the correct results in these measurements, there is
  a failure in your circuit. Check the circuit carefully and retry the tests.</P>

<UL>
  <P>See the <A HREF="fbus.htm">Testing with the Nokia Data Suite<SUP>TM</SUP>
  Software</A> paragraph in the FBUS-adapter documentation for testing the
  FBUS mode of the adapter. Please ensure that the FBUS application used
  with the adapter holds the RTS (Ready To Send) signal unasserted. The M2BUS
  application must assert the RTS signal when sending or receiving data.
