solution for mitsubishi trium mars mt050 by dup

1 read the eeprom (95256 or 25256) from phone
2 save as backup
3 copy block from #0006 (to end) to #0000
4 save it as second file
5 unlock this second 'dump' by free2000 by lovelas as old trium (maybe 
you can use another unlocker, but me don't test it)
6 copy block (in unlocked file) from #0000 to #0006
7 copy first 6 bytes from first backup here
8 write it back to phone.


that's all.
